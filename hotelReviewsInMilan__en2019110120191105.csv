We left early before breakfast was being served, but they provided us with a small bag packed with food.

6,Great location but the staff is horrible not friendly at all only if you speak French I noticed the staff was friendly to people speaking the same language but if you’re an American I didn’t find the hotel staff to be friendly at all the guy that worked on the corner that provided us with excursions was friendlier than the people at the hotel. The bathroom is so small that two people can’t be in at the same time. your bed is three steps away from the room door. I also took a picture of a bed . Do not stay at this hotel. Horrible place. They also say breakfast is included. Nothing is included. You pay for the breakfast. Horrible place.

It does have stylish & modern furnitures in my room, but the kettle wasn't real clean. It must have been in used for a long time, I wouldn't use it. A beautifully decorated dinning area, but limited selection of breakfast served.11am sharp, I was called up to leave.

It is the perfect location for a quick trip to Milan - really close to the main station (less than 5min walk) and easy access to the Metro station. The room itself was quite basic in terms of decor but it was all we needed. There were tea and coffee making facilities and a hairdryer, and the bed was very comfortable. There was also a mini fridge and we had two free bottles of water included. Breakfast was varied and fresh and the staff were helpful. ","October 12, 2018","0    Hotel Bernina

29,What a gem this place was. Close to the main train station and two metros. Hotel staff were always extremely helpful. The room was large by European standards and very clean. We chose not to have the hotel breakfast and instead had a typical Italian bar breakfast at many of the nearby establishments. Being so close to the train station meant there were a few homeless around at night but that’s no different to any major city. It was a great way to kick off our stay in Milan. ,"September 8, 2018","0    Hotel Bernina

35,"I stayed for a week in April, and while it was certainly adequate, I wouldn't return. My room was very small as was the bed. It had all the advertised amenities, free bottle of water daily, a kettle, a small fridge, AC, television with English stations etc, etc.I couldn't access the wifi and the remote for the tv was difficult to operate, I never did figure out how to turn it off and there was a glare from the screen every night for a few hours until it finally shut down. The walls were paper thin and lacked soundproofing. Of the three front desk staff I spoke with, 1 was sharp and abrupt, the other 2 were okay but not what I would call friendly, a smile would have been appreciated.I was travelling alone and I did feel safe though, it was very convenient being across the street from the main station as I used Milan as a base for day trips. I could go and get a coffee and pastry early in the morning before starting off. I didn't get breakfast because I would be l gone by 6 every morning and breakfast started later than that, plus it was quite pricey in my opinion.","June 13, 2018","0    Hotel Bernina

36,"Came across The Hotel Berna based on reviews, location and price. We had a great stay, albeit just one night. We stayed in a quality room w/ sofa. Average to larger size for similar Italian hotels. It met all of my needs in a hotel (clean, cool and quiet) at a reasonable price. Within walking distance of Milano Centrale as well as the Metro makes this a logical place to stay if arriving by train as well as being centrally located for business and pleasure activities in the city. The breakfast was outstanding as well as the service from all of the employees that we came in contact with. You can even personalize your stay prior to your arrival with the type of pillow you want, what complimentary beverages that you want stocked in the mini-fridge and what temperature you want in your room upon your arrival.

Breakfast staff were very hospitable and the food was varied and very tasty, especially the spinach and ricotta tart (which was made by the lovely senora in the kitchen). The lady also made excellent cappuccino. On the other hand I was very surprised that some of the hotel reception staff were not very sociable. As I have worked in the hospitality industry, I would always welcome customers and ask them how their day was going and in this case, the staff should have engaged in conversation with me as a tourist i.e. what have your seen today in Milan etc. Overall a very clean hotel and the staff who cleaned the room did an excellent job.","September 21, 2017","0    Hotel Bernina

Convenient to access.Room was modern and clean.<Need to be improved>Lots of mosquitoes on the roof top bar, it made us uncomfortable stay there.No slope in front of the lobby. Guests have to carry their heavy luggage for more than 10 steps.Only two units of elevator for the size of the number of rooms, which make guests wait too long.Front desk staff was impolite, he underestimates how guests feel from his attitude. Actually we asked him to call back to us and we missed it since we left the room shortly. We understand we had some responsibilities for that but what on earth then he could have such right to scold us in the public lobby for that tiny reason?!

The hotel reception kindly recommended the old town area of Brera as well. All of this was within a nice relaxing walk in the sun. I used the rooftop pool each night and the staff were friendly. The views of the Milan skyline were great and the food choices and cocktails were excellent too. I enjoyed the Spa at the hotel. I would say it was on the small side but it was fine for me as it was quiet when I was there. The hotel is a five minute walk from the Milan Centrale station so easily accessible.

Within 10min. the service guy appeared and fixed the problem together with his colleague at the reception desk (by remote control).

78,"Firstly, I must comment that the hotel is very well located and near Milan Centrale station. When we arrived, no one greeted us, no one helped us with our bags... and being hungry, I asked for food options as my child was hungry - they said there is only the bar option left. Which was basically pizza- cold. The food in the hotel is extremely limited and the staff while very helpful, are not well versed in English. For example- I wanted to hire the hotel car to take a day trip to Verona- they asked me to take a train instead. They didn't give us directions. The rooms- Clean but dusty. The plumping is weird. They said that the room downstairs complained it was ""Raining"" when we showered. On all days i found floating waste (that wasn't ours as we were all asleep during the night and the toilet was definitely clean before I went to bed) in my toilet in the morning and had to flush again and again. The rooftop is ok. Overrated. I asked for Airport Transfer - and twice, they had lost my details.

80,"Overall, I’d recommend to stay here - it’s clean, modern, helpful staff and has comfy beds. When we arrived we had a large heavy luggage and there are only stairs to get into the hotel! No slope whatsoever to get the luggage up and no one to help us. We had to drag a heavy case up stairs to even get in. The entrance is also an entrance to other buildings so is in a very random place, it’s not very luxurious. When you enter the reception you can feel it’s not Hyatt quality. The decor and the darkness all look a little tacky/dated. The check in staff were lovely! Even printed one of my online tickets for me which I’m very grateful for. Breakfast was good, good amount of choice but slightly tasteless hot options. The room was very small! I couldn’t even open my suitcase anywhere - no where to keep and open the luggage. Couldn’t even open my case out on the floor because then you can’t walk. The blinds are super noisy and slow. Bathroom was clean and modern - no complaints there! There was a kettle too. The bed was comfy and everything was fairly clean. The corridor is so dark!!! Can barely see anything - slightly eerie. Lift is extremely slow! No help with bags unless you ask but the bellboy does not have a trolley so just manually picks them up and takes your cases down the stairs. The carpet and the tiles on the staircase are really poor design and a little tacky, completely takes away from the glamour a Hyatt should have. Turns out it’s only been a Hyatt from early May 2019. 8 min walk from the station which is easy to navigate but not easy with a large case. Close to tram stop too! Supermarket and shops available in the station for amenities. We enjoyed our stay but felt this hotel could up their standards a little to be a Hyatt.","June 9, 2019","1    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

The spa costs 15 euros to use not worth it on top of the room cost. The hotel is very dark inside.

82,"After 3 years we came back to stay at this hotel again for a few days. This time we added breakfast, which we really enjoyed. It's a decent range of good quality food, fresh fruit and things like cappuccino can be ordered at no extra charge.The rooms are in the same style as on our first visit before the hotel rebranded to ""Hyatt"" – it's all modern and high quality. The room was very clean, although at one point a long hair fell out of the towels.Their information booklet in the room says you can borrow all sorts of things at the reception for the stay, including travel adapters and phone chargers, however when we asked for a USB phone charger, they didn't have any.Room service is a bit odd in this hotel. Although the room was made up nicely every day, sometimes they only took away the smaller towels without replacing them with new ones. We didn't even throw them on the floor. Either leave them where they are or replace them. There was only one spare role of toilet paper in the bathroom, but once we started using it, they never added another one for the rest of our stay, so it was not an oversight. I would expect a tiny bit more care in a hotel like this.","June 4, 2019","1    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

It just felt like the right boxes has been ticked to get the four star rating, but it didn't feel like a 4 star.

Some friends informed me that there was a grocery store in the lower level of the train station...if one wants some bottled water or snacks...Other than that, there is not one shop around the hotel for such things. The staff was helpful and accommodating as I became familiar with the many switches in the room. Yes, the hallways are dark...the neon room numbers are cool though.I stayed in a junior spa suit. The room had three floor to ceiling windows. The room was large and very bright and felt wonderful to walk into after a busy day. So, the dark hallways did not bother me.

Then the room as we walked in we turned the lights on they didn’t work so we called reception they sent someone to fix it and we went out for a bit, when we returned to our room later on we wanted to see and use the spa at the cost of €15 per person per use we paid a lot of money for the room you would of thought it would of been free for guests. We left the aircon on the coldest setting until we returned to our room when we got back it was boiling and blowing out hot air so hot in fact we had to stay in the hallway for cool air again had to get it fixed. At check out we told the lady about our problems and she refunded us our mini bar and spa usage even so I think with the money the room cost plus the service you expect from the Hyatt chain these problems should happen in the first place.

90,"I came here for a short weekend break with my best friend from London and we found it to exceed our expectations. Summary is as follows:Location - Hotel in the the best location! Short walk (5mins) from central station - which you can get the train directly to the airport and lake Como. Also short cab ride to the main shopping area and cathedral.Room/hotel - A little on the small side but modern decor and very clean as is the rest of the hotel. Had a great nights sleep with minimal noise. Spa - Extra surcharge to use the spa but we didn't mind as we had it entirely to ourselves! The pool could be warmer but other than that great ambiance, very clean/well maintained.Staff - Majority were very helpful and polite, except from one young lady at reception who when asked told us there was no shopping centre nor anywhere to do shopping in Milan. I know right? She was rather patronising and abrupt when asked where to find Gucci/LV stores and instead directed us to the 'lower end shops'. Her much friendlier colleague (young man at front desk) gave us a map and showed us where the 8floor mall was located and other sites of interest.Breakfast - Good selection, small dining area. 5* to the lovely pastries and cakes every morning.The rooftop bar was closed during our stay as spring season hadn't fully commenced yet, but were welcome to have a look around. Would definitely return here again when staying in Milan.","April 26, 2019","1    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

91,"The hotel itself is nice and the room has been spacious but from a technical perspective the setup is too complicated given that the building is rather new. There are around 10 buttons to serve the light (even with a printed menu on what each button does). Also for the remote control, the TV usage wasn‘t intuitively (therefore another instruction was printed to explain it to the guests). There are around 200 Italian channels but only around 5 international news channels in English language. Not really good enough for an international hotel chain. Given that we have reached the digital age, it would be not too much of an ask to support at least HDMI access or a smart TV to overcome this problem","April 22, 2019","1    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

95,"In short, better to spend €40 more and stay at next door Hilton or Sheraton. I chose this hotel because of SOFITEL Accor membership but understood it was a big mistake the moment I entered the hotel and saw the ground floor rooms like dark prison cell they offered me. It has nothing to relate to first class Accor hospitality nor Sofitel service. After such disappointment I regretfully booked at another hotel despite prepaid room at the Lagare hotel.

The rooms are modern but still cosy and the whole infrastructure very satisfactory. Unfortunately, the roof terrace on the 13th floor was closed (it's only open in summer) But what a view!

98,"My impression of the hotel: Slightly rude service, nothing works and everything costs extra.Lighting, curtains and the disco-esque color-changing LED-light in the window were controlled by a panel in the room, which was clearly of Italian design. 16 buttons, and no indication of what would happen when pushing each of the buttons. Extremely frustrating! I also do not understand why I would want to adjust the toilet lighting from the bedside?The electronic curtains were very loud when being lowered/raised. I could hear when my next door neighbors woke up due to the noise of their curtains being lifted.I asked for an iron for my shirt, but they had none. I could have my shirt ironed by their service during some specific hours... for an extra charge obviously. If you make up rules of an iron being not allowed in the room, you should at least provide one in a common ironing room etc.The hotel building is very tall, but there are only 2 ""Italian style"" extremely slow elevators. Every trip to the lobby took 3-4 minutes due to this.Breakfast was mediocre at best. Everything looked like it had been on the table for a bit too long. Regardless of paying for a breakfast during booking, an omelette from the kitchen cost 8€ extra. This seems weird considering the price range.The hotel had a spa, which as I understand consisted of a sauna and lounge chairs. The price was not included in the hotel stay, and was around 16 €. Seems like a total ripoff.","January 28, 2019","1    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

100,"I'm frequent traveller and Accor addicted since years, so I always choose Accor hotels around the world. Normally I rate 5 stars for every Sofitel and/or McGallery structure, but for LaGare in Milan was not the case. When I made the reservation I asked for an early check-in and I didn't get; I also asked for a Nespresso machine in the room and I didn't get. I would have expected to know that upfront (maybe by email or call) instead of realizing when I arrived. Last, should be great if breakfast started at least at 6.30 am instead of 7am or - at least - having a bar available for espresso 24hrs.","January 13, 2019","1    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

101,"The hotel is close to Central Station, and you can get there from Malpensa airport by the train service (which is often unreliable, sadly). It is also close to subway station.When you arrive, a huge stair is waiting for you in front of the hotel. They have someone to help you with bags, but if there are a lot of people upstairs and down, you would have to wait for a while for your turn.The biggest problem here are the elevators, as they have huge number of rooms and only two elevators. You would wait for ages on the morning before elevator will arrive, a huge planning oversights.Breakfast is nice, but selection stays the same, and it is rather modest. I stayed for 5 nights and I could not see those same dishes anymore. They also reuse yesterday's pastry, which is an embarrassment for a 4-star hotel. Breakfast room is very small and it is packed with tables, very hard to walk around without a risk of bumping into somebody. And it is unpleasant to eat here with people constantly hovering over you.Also, they do not provide irons to the rooms, you have to use their service, and I did not see anything like this in my entire travel experience.","December 28, 2018","1    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

Waiting staff were impeccable.I was on a business group booking so the menu for the evening meal was limited - should not have been a problem. First evening. Ravioli pretty al dente but filling was nice. Turbot was overcooked to jelly - what a crime!Second evening. Pasta so al dente it was barely cooked - inedible. Pork fillet served with a bloody, raw centre - a risk to health and not touched. No offer of any alternatives. Went to bed hungry.Reception staff excellent.

It looks like you need to book directly with the hotel through their website.There are quite a few restaurant and snack options within 10 minutes walk and the busy shopping street - Corso Buenos Aires - is close by.Our bedroom and ensuite bathroom with shower (in an adjoining building next to the main building) were comfortable and well serviced.

135,"Stayed here during our Italy trip. Hotel was only a 10-15 minutes' walk to Milano Centrale which suited us perfectly. Don't be put off by the general ""old"" (and maybe slightly rundown) look of the buildings and shops as you walk down the main road, Via Vitruvio, to the hotel. Entrance to the hotel was not grand but you get that ""good feel"" about it when you enter the place. Breakfast was included but don't expect a spread - think minimal. Rooms and bathrooms were clean and nice. Friendly staff - they even understood our need for more internet access (my son was watching something or other on youtube during our stay there). Easy walk to Lima metro station (on Line 1) which took us to the Duomo area and Conciliazone (the latter for The Last Supper viewing). The hotel owner recommended an Italian restaurant, Sabatino, which was within easy walking distance, for dinner on our first night in Milano. Wonderful food and wine!! By that time on our trip, my husband was already getting tired of pasta and pizzas ... we stumbled across this Chinese restaurant which served yummy yummy food at relatively cheap prices. Surprise - the restaurant was just a stone's throw from the hotel!!","May 26, 2015","2    Charly

We had a room on the ground floor of a second adjoining building so it was probably more convenient than rooms on the 2 or 3 higher floors.Breakfast was cold and continental but, again, more than adequate.WiFi was always available although user name and password changed each day.The staff were all helpful and pleasant, although we did not have too much need to talk to them.The location is very convenient to the main railway station, although the street on which it is located is nothing special. However, the Google Maps instructions for walking the 7 minutes from the station to the hotel were not clear, mainly because you are never sure of your drop off point/starting point (it is a big station) and which initial direction to walk in.Make sure you walk down the major road (Via Vitruvio) in front of the main station entrance (Piazza Duca d' Aosta) not the side of the station where the buses arrive (Piazza Savoia) - off of which you will find a parallel road (Scarlatti), which can be a bit dark and intimidating at night.","December 14, 2014","2    Charly

170,"Booked standard double room. The room was exactly what I expected given the prce paid for staying 2 nights. Clean and spacious room and bathroom. Modern bathroom. Wifi was included along with free secure parking in the Hotel underground car park. Options for breakfast were good and typical of what would be expected in Italy. Our original room had problems with heating and so was cold on arrival. After letting the reception desk know and them trying to increase the temperature from there end with no success, they moved/upgraded us to a suite room. Reception desk were very helpful in advising us of local restaruarnts to eat at and on the transport routes available to get us into the main centre of Milan. They were also helpful in letting us leave our bags in a secure area after checkout on the last day whilst we explored Milan before driving out of Milan. Very good service and hotel for the price paid. Would recommend to anyone wanting to travel to Milan that doesn't mind travelling to the centre for around 40mins via bus/tram. The No 14 tram located 5 mins walk from the hotel takes you just outside the main sqaure infront of the Duomo.","January 6, 2019","3    iH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio

177,"By price, this hotels can give you better offer than other, similar Milan Hotels, because of the distance from downtown and attraction level around the Hotel. I mean, on foot, not so much to see around the Hotel as it's more like an outskirt office area of the city. There is a tram (Nr. 14) goes to downtown (Duomo) 21 stations, fro the single price of EUR 1.5 (Bigletto urbano - you can by at near kiosk, but not at the station). Hotel was fine, nicely furnitured, even the extra bed (couch) was with one affordable matrace built in. The air condition setting fixed, could not really set and turning off seemed to be impossible. And it was a bit noisy during the night.Cleaning service was excellent and kind. Breakfast with wide variation of cakes and excellent fresh pastries was fine. Capuccino and omlet - extra charge - it's a pitty. Reception desk, check in, check out was smooth and proper. Parking is free (regular price could be from EUR 16/day in Milan) inside the undergound garage.

212,Stayed for two wonderful days in this amazing B&B. Lorenzo was very easy to contact and nothing was to much trouble. The pictures don't do it justice everything is designer furniture and there are so many extras added in. The area is an extremely nice area of Milan and because it is in a secure complex felt very safe.

221,"I first have to mention that the description of “available beds” is inaccurate. The “sofa beds” are actually real mattresses on a wooden support, the size of a twin bed, which are by all means much better! We were a party of four and absolutely needed additional two separate beds. Everyone definitely had a good night sleep. I usually discard rooms with sofa beds. However from the beginning via email, Flavio was very helpful and immediately reassured me they would put in an extra bed if necessary. The appartment was very clean. Beds were very comfy. I appreciated the spotless white bed linen. Flavio and Annie were very helpful and extremely nice and welcoming people. The appartment and staff deserve a 5. However, the only reason I rated it 4 was due to the location. Not as central as I had expected it. The building is beautiful and well-kept, you have a parking nearby but public transport it’s a bit far for people who have physical disabilities like me. The 7 mins walk to the tram it would take anybody, was a 20min walk for me. Took taxis thereafter to Piazza del Duomo which is 2.1km away. I definitely recommend this place.

228,"Suitime was a very comfortable and convenient place to stay in Milan, and the owners, Flavio and Rudina, are wonderful hosts! They gave us all the info we needed ahead of time to access the building where the suites are located, and they were very friendly and helpful when they met us at check-in. The suites were very clean and bright and equipped with helpful amenities, such as bath products, coffee & tea, and a mini fridge. The beds were comfortable, and the bathrooms were spacious. Potential visitors should be aware that each suite has two levels with a staircase in between them. Also the room on the 2nd level is like a loft area with an inset railing that overlooks the first floor, so the two levels are not completely separate and private from each other. For our group of family and friends, it was a fine arrangement to share space but also have some separation of living space.The historic building that the suites are located in is beautiful, including the inner courtyard that leads to the hallway where the rooms are. The neighborhood is clean and safe... there is absolutely no disturbance from the prison facility across the street. We found a great cafe nearby called Colonial Cafe to have coffee & breakfast at each morning, so it's no problem that breakfast is not provided at the suites. Suitime is located only about 600 m, or a 7-8 minute walk, from the Conciliazione Metro stop, so getting to and from sites around Milan is no problem.We took a 2-day trip to Lake Como, and Flavio & Rudina were very accommodating to let us leave our large luggage with them until we came back. Upon our return, we rented a car, and Flavio was very helpful to let us know about needing to pay for a city tax required for driving in the city center of Milan and how to buy the ticket for it, which the car rental office had not told us anything about.","November 25, 2016","5    Suitime Milano

Suitime is also handy for walking to Duomo and Castle. The only negative for me was the open plan up and down,which meant one can hear the tv upstairs from the bedroom below (only a negative for couples with 1 person liking to stay up late!).

True, this is not a coventional, full-service hotel. It offers immaculate accommodation in effectively small, but astonishingly well-designed and comfy apartments. To a person, our group was COMPLETELY charmed and overwhelmed by the thoughtful graciousness of our dynamic and delightful hosts, Rudina and Flávio. While it's true the fact that they do not reside on-premise, they were often on-hand and completely engaged in ensuring that our stay was in every respect without spot, flaw or wrinkle. The neighborhood is agreeably quiet and decidedly elegant, as well as interesting. Tourist sights are nearby, as well as a good food market, delightful neighborhood restaurant, caffe and gelato options. We ADORED everything about Suitime.

The room is separated in two floors - on the first you have the bedroom and bathroom and on the second floor something like a living room and kitchen. Everything was very clean and modern. The flexibility to be able to cook is priceless when you arrive at 12 in the night and all restaurants are closed :)Regarding location - you can easily walk to Duomo within 20 minutes...and on the way you already see some nice parts of the city.To sum up - this is probably one of the best places in Milan that you can get for this money range!

The place, which is technically a bed and breakfast, is definitely unusual for Milanese standards, inside a beautiful old building; I understand suites vary in size, mine was quite small (hence the bed no suitable for two tall adults); but having the second floor, with the kitchen and the single bed, is excellent for small families. Modern decor, I personally find the apartments too hot and a bit claustrophobic, being below the street level, but probably that's just me. For less than 140 euros/night, it's a good choice.","December 1, 2014","5    Suitime Milano

245,"The only hotel/apartment I have stayed in all my tours where the owners overshadow the hotel ! Flávio and Rudina are such excellent and caring hosts that words fail me. And this despite the fact that I did not have the pleasure of meeting them during my two day stay.My stay in Milan was a tough one with my baggage not arriving for two days straight making our Italy trip a real non starter. But Flávio was continuously in touch making us feel at home through his calls, his humorous nature and caring ways. They make you feel that they represent the hospitality of their country. And deal with you straight from the heart and not in a strictly commercial way. I did not find this hospitality even in Rome and I am glad that they were the first Italians I ment in Italy !I would not say the Milano Suitime is a luxury experience but it is a very very comfortable place to stay. Perfectly located to start tours. And very comfortable. I loved the fact that it is housed with other buildings and you have to get in with an access code to the building ! Made us feel very local and very Italian :-)We had two good nights of sleep here and had no problem getting anywhere from here. It is close to bus/metro stations and yet far enough to be peaceful. Which makes for a good nights sleep as well. Ideally suited for people looking for value for money but with a touch of style and local flavour.Just to share, the hotel helped me even after departure as I required some mails for claiming delayed baggage insurance. This is a big deal as most hotels simply forget after you checkout. Checkin to Suitime for a relationship with Italy. And my best regards once again to Flávio and Rudina.","October 17, 2014","5    Suitime Milano

Although there was no 24 hour reception there was always someone online or by sms who is available. The apartment is in a very quiet residential neighborhood and arriving late at night opening the gate into a courtyard dark at first gave me a bit of a chill but was totally beautiful when lit and i had figured my way around to my apartment.The place has 2 floors with a living room on the 2nd floor and the bedroom on the first. I had the best night's rest with their very comfortable bed.I chanced upon a cafe a few meters down Via Vico . still open which was next to a gym and was welcomed by the chef himself. The location is perfect especially if you are in town for the fair as the nearest metro station Conciliazione is just a few minutes walk and runs directly to the Rho for the fair and to the city center (ex. DUOMO). The Cadorna station which has the Malpensa Express is 5 minutes by taxi.On my last day, i met the owner Flavio and his colleague Christian who were very warm and helpful contrary to most of those you meet at the airport or some establishments ....hardly speaks any english and seem they can't be bothered if you dont speak the language.Oh and Rudina, too!!

It's being located in a kind of old Italian palazzo but inside you will find modern high-tech designed two-leveled snall but very cosy and comfortable suite.I will not list here everything what they offer for this very very reasonable price (it's impressive anyway), but the most important are the people running this hotel. Two Italian brothers - very nice, honest and friendly young people who help you not only with your luggage but with every smallest detail, explain you everything you need and, the most important, let you feel like you are the one and only very best guest of their hotel!I think we all should support this young business project if we want to make our world a bit better.Best recommendation!Prof. Peter Ovtcharov,Seoul/South Korea","August 28, 2014","5    Suitime Milano

249,"I slept at SUITIME for 4 nights with my colleagues and boss when we came to Milan to attend a conference. The rooms are spacious, elegant, there's everything you need and more. The kitchen is very modern, and includes an espresso machine, pans, cutlery etc. There's a lot of privacy if you are sharing the room with another person, as beds are located on different floors of the same room. The location is also very good, linked to buses, trams, metro and a train station (Milano Cadorna). The quality price ratio is great considering that a room can host up to three people and has bedroom+bathroom+kitchen/livingroom, 2 tvs, air conditioning etc...it's like being in your own apartment. Flavio and Rudina are extremely kind, friendly and always available for every type of need you may have - my colleagues and boss literally fell in love with them and we ended up buying a bottle of wine to thank them for being so nice to us! Highly recommended for everyone who wants to have a nice stay in Milan, you won't be disappointed.","July 10, 2014","5    Suitime Milano

250,"I have spent 11 nights staying at this fabulous suite with excellent service of Flavio and Rudina. I feel blessed that I have opportunity to stay here for such a long time. First of all, I booked the suite via expedia.sg. The price is reasonable for the stay and so much worth for it. The room is so spacious, clean and with good design of the furnitures. Everyday there will be a cleaner to tidy the room, replenish the toiletries and drinking water in the fridge. The best thing ever is the room even equipped with espresso coffee machine. So the coffee capsules ( both caffein and as well as decafeined) will be replenished daily together with the biscuits and cookies as well. What a lovely service for the guest who stays in the suite. In addition, the location of the suite is strategic and only less than 10mins walk to the metro station. There is an attraction nearby to see "" The Last Supper"" by Leonardo da Vinci with just 10mins walking distance. There are some nice restaurants nearby as well as Mcdonald. I feel safe staying the area as I was travelling alone. Even this suite does not have 24 hours reception, Flavio and Rudina provide 24/7 services and they were so helpful to answer any of my questions at any times. They make me feel like home. I really appreciate what they did to let me had a pleasant stay in Milan. On my last day of stay, I even received a sweet and lovely surprise gift by Flavio and Rudina with a sweet note attached. They are really the kindest couple that I have ever meet in Milan. Whoever want to find a special lodging other than the normal routine hotel, please choose to stay here and you will be no regret.","May 20, 2014","5    Suitime Milano

259,"First of all, i would like to point out that the reception staff is really friendly.and well run.Also the cleanliness of the rooms was great and the bed really comfortable.Byt having stayed at a number of Radisson hotels and knowing that the BLU line, has to be one notch above the rest, i have to say the hotel kitchen leaves a bit to be desired. The first day at the breakfast, which closes at 10.30, you get the feeling at 10.15, that you are no longer wanted, as they start clearing the tables.It is also worth noting, that the juices are not fresh, which i have at least come to expect from a BLU line hotel.Later the same evening we ordered dinner at the bar, where the fries were soft and the club sandwich cold. The morning of our departure, we finally also noticed that after having ordered pancakes and a omelet from the kitchen, that these were not fresh either. We found out quite simply, because it was ready and served withing 30 seconds of ordering.","August 1, 2019","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

264,"This isn't the best Radisson Blu I've stayed in, it feels rather faded and unloved. Worn buttons on lifts, cracks in the washbasin, TV remote held together by sticky tape (which didn't work because it fell apart in my hand). Skirting boards were scuffed and the room had a slightly odd musty smell when I arrived. The TV in my room had really poor image quality so I'm guessing the internal cable system is as dated as the rest of the infrastructure. The AC struggled, and never managed to get the room as cool as I wanted. The room has a kettle to make tea or (instant) coffee.There's a good sized desk if you want to work, and the WiFi is adequate, however the desk only had one power socket which really isn't enough for the collection of electronics I carry around on business trips. There doesn't appear to be any option for room service (or if there was I never found a room service menu). There's a reasonable restaurant which isn't exactly haute cuisine but provided me with a good scallop starter and a veal main course.The best feature of this Radisson was the staff in both reception and the restaurant, who were very friendly.The hotel's a fairly long way from the centre of Milan, so might not be ideal if you're a tourist, and if you're here on business you may need to allow plenty of time for a taxi to take you somewhere in the morning traffic. Bottom line: probably won't stay here again until / unless they do a major refurb.","July 7, 2019","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

It is just that the passage of time and people has left its mark and a renovation should come in the immediate future. Till then, the hotel is perfectly adequate and the service is just fine.

291,"Stayed here for 3 nights , not in a tourist area of the city. It is a 25 minute tram ride from outside of the hotel into the Duomo area and tourist Centre. They let us check in early at arrival. The rooms are modern with nice beds , excellent buffet breakfast and professional staff. Gym and sauna on site. You can get a good nights sleep here and are still close enough to take in the sights. Nice toiletries with bathrobes and slippers etc. ","September 9, 2018","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

292,"I was booked in for the weekend of the Italian GP,due to convenience of trains to the track,as well the reputation of value for money the Radison group has build up.I was booked into room number 444,only to find that the basin plug was unable to be opened,and the bath plug did not seal,this room did not have a shower,so bathing was the only option.The inter-leading door had water stains running down,the ceiling had hand marks around the smoke detector,the carpets were filthy,the coffee tray was swollen and chipped,the curtains were ill fitting and appeared to have been for different sized windows, the final nail was when the TV switched on,but could not switch off,due to the poor state of the remote.I complained,and the reception Lady was very accommodating,and moved me to room number 731,the overall appearance of this room was much improved,however,the basin in the bathroom did not drain,the shower door leaked when showering,and the bathroom door was water damaged and swollen.The positive was all the staff were very pleasant,but the facilities including the sauna wet area are in need of some serious management attention.I do have photos should management show interest.","September 5, 2018","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

293,"Firstly be aware that the hotel is quite some distance from the centre, however this is made easy as there is a tram stop just a few steps from the hotel, and tickets available from reception. Aside from this, a very clean hotel with added bonuses : sweets and water in reception, free water in room, nespresso machine, best hotel hairdryer I’ve found, very large room (117), good breakfast, restaurant on the premises for dinner (important as it’s far out of the centre), good internet connection, indoor pool, very reasonable gym. No complaints and especially convenient for attending Monza as the train station was very nearby. Perhaps being out of the hectic bustle of Milan centre isn’t a bad thing either, although it’s about 25 Minutes on the tram.","September 4, 2018","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

294,"Actually came back from here today, I was looking forward to writing the review.Before arriving I informed the hotel I was coming to celebrate my second year anniversary (14/08) and they did not disappoint. Arrived on the Monday to such professional and welcoming staff. We were told we had been upgraded to a king suite and someone would be up to see us soon.Walking in we were greeted by strawberries with chocolate and a lovely note. Five minutes later a bottle of champagne and glasses were brought up to our room, this was a lovely surprise.The room itself was clean and had all the things you would need. The king size bed was comfortable and gave us a great nights sleep- no noise outside. Bathroom had a best feature (husband said it is a must add to review) when refreshing etc you are able to listen to the tv (English channels only news) through a speaker - can be turned down if you want quiet time.Called down for extra milk and tea, these arrived in good time considering we were on the 9th floor again by professional staff.There is a spa and gym available for your leisure. If we needed a taxi we could press M2 and ask them to call before we got down. Be aware the taxi begins charging from the time of the call so make sure you are ready to hop in as soon as they arrive- usually takes them 3-6 minutes to get there.Location is out of the way and local shops bar two or three food and market shops were open during the night and day so did need to taxi out to other areas. Travel from airport- cheaper to hop onto a coach/bus €8 get into the central train station and get a taxi around €20 from there. Taxi from the airport costs roughly €100.Definitely worth the stay and would love to come back in the future.","August 15, 2018","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

297,"First let's just get it out there: the location is awful. It is in a run down area of Milan, well away from the sights. I was there because I was doing something with the Politechnico, and frankly I imagine that's the only reason anyoneo would be there. But that said...The hotel was really nice. Our room was large, with a cool multi-room suite layout. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom large and modern. They had a very nice range of branded amenities in the bathroom (I'm an amenity snob; I cannot help it, I used to sell little shampoos and conditioners to hotels when I worked for P&G and you can tell a lot about a hotel by the amenities it chooses). It wasn't a brand I was familiar with but my daughter recognized it, and they included the extra things like a toothbrush, shaving kit, etc. See how easy it is to win me over? But I haven't even gotten to the really good stuff. There was a lovely indoor pool that really made the hotel fun for my kids. The water was a little cold for my tastes, but they had a blast, and the benefit of them playing in cooler water is they crash out for hours afterward, so we're all winners. But the BEST part of the hotel is probably the breakfast buffet! First, it's a stylish area with an ample spread. It was definitely higher end than the other breakfast buffets we had while in Italy. But the highlight was definitely the fresh, full-sized vegan croissants!! Score!! We went vegan about six months ago and it's usually hard to find vegan food when we travel. I had pretty much written off things like croissants. But these weren't just vegan croissants, they were EXCEPTIONAL vegan croissants! My kids talked about them for the rest of the trip (and we stayed at four hotels after this one!) They were so good that I'm including a picture. So, Radisson Blu, you had disappointed me in Leeds, but you won me back in Milan. I'm happy we're on good terms again.","July 7, 2018","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

Negatives are: Shower in my room was inside bath tub with no glass cover or shower curtain to keep the water from making the whole bathroom wet; TV picture HORRIBLE, this was during the World Cup....Internet very slow.

The equipment of the hotel: the fitness room is very well equiped, the sauna and steamroom are small but nice and the swimming pool is large enough but quite cold. The parking is very useful since parking in the street is not easy.

301,"We stayed at the Radisson Blu in November with my friend, having a great spacious room on the 2nd floor. We were very nicely welcomed and greeted by the reception staff and their service was outstanding the whole time of our stay. The staff at the bar and at the restaurant were great too - there's really nothing we could complain about. We went to the bar and to the restaurant both evenings we've been there and had a nice chat with the staff - it felt really amazing.Now the location - the hotel is not exactly in the city centre but it's soo easy to get there. Just a tram ride where you can rest before and after the day spent in the city. They have the tram tickets at the reception. Also the whole staff speaks great English.And last - the pool and the gym were amazing as well! :) If I'll go to Milan ever again I will choose Radisson Blu again for sure!

303,"What more can you ask?This is one of our favourite hotels now.We got there a bit frazzeld by a flight from Edinburgh/45min taxi drive, and slightly early to check in. The 'bellhop' came to take our bags from the taxi, took us inside. The receptionist checked us in straightaway while the bellhop plied us with lemon water. I mentioned to receptionist about our trip to St Moritz on Tues, when a bus (I thought) would be picking us up. Buses dont normally call here, she said, and copied our trip details, phoning us later to say that a SUV would pick us up and driver would wait in reception. In the meantime, the bellhop (I do wish Id taken their names) took us and bags to our room, made sure the air con worked, and arranged for a porter to bring us milk for our tea.The room was on floor 2, near the lift, over looking the courtyard next to the restaurant, protected from the traffic noise by a row of tall trees. There was minimal noise from inside or outside the hotel. The bathroom was great, including a multihead shower room, plenty of storage. The room had loads of wardrobe and drawer space and space for cases, minibar (reasonably priced), safe, TV with English news channels, bedside tables, a comfy club chair and footstool and comfy chair to sit at desk console. Nicely decorated.We couldnt face going out for dinner so went to hotel bar. All items on the main course food menu were between euro 10 and 18. I chose lasagna, he chose macaroni. Both were in an absolutely gorgeous meaty tomatoey sauce. There is only one draft lager in the bar, but it was very good, on a par with Stella. The drinks menu included long cocktails, all for about e12, so we had one each night. We availed ourselves of the bar meals each night after treks round Milan/S Moritz, and found the food great, bar ambience good and friendly.Our booking included breakfast, which although buffet style, was equally good. The hot selection was crispy, very tasty bacon, Italian sausage not to our taste, scrambled eggs, and 'coddled' eggs ie eggs cooked in an egg cup, but just right with runny yolk. Him indoors reckoned really good. There was the usual fruit juice and yoghurt, fresh fruit and cereal selection, loaf bread, croissants and bread buns in all shapes and sizes, and the cold selection defied belief: vast array of cheeses, cold meats, smoked salmon etc etc Lovely atmosphere in the restaurant as in the bar.The hotel is near a small train station, bus route and tram route. We twice used the tram (you can get a ticket from reception), other times we used taxis which reception booked for us.All the staff were really helpful, friendly and professional. I hadnt been expecting it in Italy, and was worried about the language barrier. However, they all spoke very good English.The only negative is that its a little way out of central Milan, so because of the never ending graffiti in Italy the area can look a bit run down (but then so does central Milan with gorgeous buildings covered in stuff Banksy would be ashamed to be associated with).The tram fare each way is e1.50, and taxi about e12.If Im being supremely picky, some of the paintwork in our room was showing signs that its time for a lick of paint, but nothing significantWhats not to like?","May 27, 2018","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

304,"I must admit we choose this hotel initially as we could use our QANTAS points. Having said that it was a great stay. The hotel is large and modern with all the things you would expect. The staff were fantastic. Helped us in every way. Directions, maps, local information. Can’t speak more highly of them. The rooms were spacious and spotless. Tea and coffee making facilities and a mini fridge. Local supermarket a short walk away. The hotel is very close to the #22 tram and metro so no problem getting back to the centre in about 25-30 minutes. However if you want to be right in the centre with all the city attractions and restaurants at your finger tip then this may not be the hotel for you. There is a great pool which was sadly closed for annual works while we were there. I think the biggest downfall of this hotel is the very high price for breakfast. No doubt perfect for business people putting the cost on an account but absolutely out of the reach of a family of mum dad and a couple of kids staying for a week for example. €25 per person per day. No doubt the food was extensive and lovely but it is absolutely price inhibitive for most, except for a treat. ","May 26, 2018","6    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

305,"We were very happy with our recent stay at the Lancaster. The staff are very well trained and really helpful with good advice. We took their recommendation for a local restaurant with homemade pasta and were so pleased we visited it twice.Advice on the finer points of Italian coffee was explained to my daughter at breakfast, and there was always a friendly smile at the reception desk. The Lancaster is a historic building and this results in a slightly small room, not really a problem unless you plan to bring lots of suitcases. Our room had effective double glazing and shutters which kept out any noise that was outside. The bed was comfortable and the shower powerful.A substantial breakfast was included in our room price. We liked the location which is slightly out of the main tourist area, however this is no disadvantage as the frequent trams whisk you to your next sight.","September 28, 2019","7    Lancaster Hotel

There were plenty of nice bars and restaurants around yet you were in a nice quiet residential street.

The mini bar is reasonably priced too at €2 for water, it's not much more expensive than the shops. Breakfast is included from 7-10 am. There is enough choice of pastries, cereals, fruit and bacon, sausage and egg. The staff make you feel like you are staying with friends rather than a hotel. It's 5 minute walk from Sempione Park and the Arch. There are also lots of restaurants and bars around if you don't want to venture far.

325,"Me and my family had a very nice experience at this hotel close to the Arco della Pace in Milan. The hotel itself is situated in a beautiful Art Noveau building containing a lot of details. The rooms are quite typical 3-star but nice and comfortable with all the basic things you need. They also serve a small but nice breakfast buffet and the hotel also boasts a nice bar. The main reason to stay at this hotel though, and i really want to highlight this thing, is their fantastic service. The hotel beams a very familiar atmosphere combined with outstanding service. You really have the feeling of being taken care of. The staff here is amazing and hence the high rating.","November 5, 2018","7    Lancaster Hotel

329,Holding true to their presentation on the website Lancaster hotel is a smaller hotel just outside the really most central part of Milan with great service as their top priority. We got all the help we could ask for when asked for. The breakfast was perfect in it s own way with all the ingredients you want without being unnecessary grand. Good gluten free bread and crackers when asked for! Outside the most central part of Milan is not a problem as that means within walking distance of the most relevant attractions in the City. Walking to the Duomo took approx. 30min. Closest tram 10min. Closest metro 15min. Two great Gelato shops approx. 10min.Thank you so much for your hospitality Lancaster! ,"September 14, 2018","7    Lancaster Hotel

They were eager to help us plan our outings in and around Milan on our first visit to the city.Our room was large and comfortable. There was a large wall-mounted TV, maybe 50 inches. There was a minibar in room and you can ask in the bar for a complimentary bottle of water for the room. Large bathroom with two basins, tub/shower, bidet. Unfortunately, we found that it was impossible to shower without getting the floor very wet. The tub enclosure covered less than half of the tub and was leaking at the bottom.There was a tasty breakfast buffet with lots of variety--hot bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs. There were also cold cuts, bread and rolls, fruit, yogurt, pastries, juices, and all kinds of coffee and tea.

It was a good size and the balcony had good views. Breakfast each morning was lovely, plenty to choose from. Choice of cooked items, bread, pastries and even cakes and doughnuts. About 10 minutes walk to an area with restaurants and about 25 mins to main tourist area. Lovely walk through the park and castle though.

342,"We loved the Lancaster Hotel! We arrived quite early and they took our luggage and even offered us a room earlier if we wanted. We used the general bathroom and went on our way in to Milan via the tram routes which the staff helpfully explained to us. We were able to purchase a 24 hour tram ticket from reception which I highly recommend. Upon our arrival back that afternoon our bags were already up in the room! The room was clean and quite spacious. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the Cadorna train station through a lovely park. It is in a nice restaurant district; most restaurants did a buffet service but as we wanted something authentic for our first night in Italy, we went to ‘Mammina pizzeria e cucina genuina’ down a side street close to the hotel which we really enjoyed! Breakfast at the hotel was the best we had on our trip; every food available under the sun! The staff made amazing coffee and were helpful answering questions about local shopping etc. The next day we checked out and they again held our luggage while we explored before returning to collect it on our way to Milan Centrale station. Would 100% stay here again. Great location, great service, great rooms and fantastic breakfast :)","May 18, 2018","7    Lancaster Hotel

343,"My wife and I started our tour of Italy in Milan May 4th and 5th and wish We would have stayed longer. The service is so first rate you can’t help but brag about the place. My wife first saw the building and lived the outside and when we went in she loved it also. We arrived at 9am well before our room was ready, and met Leonardo who was AMAZING! He explained the hote was one of the few buildings intact after WWII bombing and fighting and also told us to drop our backpacks and mapped out some places we could go until formally checking in around noon. The hote is located just over a block from Parco Sempiore which is one of the main parks. On one end it has the Napoleon peace arch and the opposite end Sforza Castle. The park in between is gorgeous and not even the light drizzle stopped us in any way. After walking the park and seeing the castle, we kept waking out the other end and enjoyed a great bottle of Vino. By the way, it was past 5 at home and there are no bad bottles of wine in Italy. We then headed back to the hotel to see our room and then get cleaned up for dinner. They don’t eat very early in Italy and lots of placesDon’t even open until 7pm. Leonardo recommended a place we could walk to and we made it close, but ended up eating elsewhere. It was amazingly delicious and worth the walk. It was by now 9:30, so we took a taxi back rather then walking. We had done about 6+ miles that day. When we got back we met Aldo at the desk and Antonino was manning the bar at the hotel. We cracked a bottle of wine and talked with a Swedish couple on vacation and once they went to bed we chatted with Aldo until almost 2 am. Next day was more re walking and sightseeing and plenty of Vino. Valeria and others worked the desk as well and all were first class and should be recognized as that. We even met the owner our last day there and let him know how great everyone was. He runs a great place and we LOVED the hote and every inch of Milano we visited.","May 12, 2018","7    Lancaster Hotel

348,"We stayed at the Lancaster hotel for one night only, because we had troubles with someone and so we've been brought there.As we entered in, we could tell that the staff and employees were so nice to - just decent and sweet people welcoming us.As we entered the our room, we could feel the warmness of it, for a 3 Star hotel, I have to admit that the rooms are more than adjusting. The mattress was so good, so we had a very good sleep, in total I would say that the atmosphere was just nice and we felt very comfortable in our room. The next morning we went to have the breakfast that was included, we've been welcomed very nicely there as well, the chef of the hotel made sure we'd get a coffee, the buffet was bigger than expected, for Italian standard very high-quality was incredibly good and also we got another one for free.The waiters were so nice, we asked for hot water with some tea cans and other stuff, we've been given these things without been asked for our room number and for free, of course.It is a small hotel, but that ""small"" is just great, we felt so welcomed and everyone, staff and chef were so nice. Couldn't imagine to have the same comfort in another 3 Star hotel-it was definitely worth an experience & my friend and I would definitely stay there again, no question. If you walk a couple of minutes, you have a metro system, but we thought walking suit us better, so we walked into the centre twice, which took us 15ins only. It's good for the feet and you can see a lot. After we checked out, we took a picture with the owner of the hotel, who was just the sweetest and nicest owner you could imagine.

The Reception offers a 24hr service. All staff speak very good English and are extremely efficient and happy to assist in any way that they can.Our room (223) was spacious with twin beds, TV, safety deposit box and a very reasonably priced mini bar. A kettle with a selection of tea and coffee was also provided. Our bathroom was again spacious, with twin basins, a bath with overhead shower, w/c, bidet, heated towel rail and hairdryer. Complimentary toiletries and bath/hand towels were also provided.The bedroom and the doors leading onto the balcony from the bathroom were double glazed with additional shutters. We were at the front of the hotel and experienced some noise from the road, but it certainly didn't bother us.Housekeeping is of an exceptionally high standard and the hotel is spotlessly clean throughout.Breakfast offers a wide choice of cereals, eggs, bacon, cold meats, cheese, fruit, yoghurts and cakes with a choice of teas, coffees and juices. Staff are extremely attentive (without being intrusive) and food is regularly replenished.Central Milan is a 20-30 minute walk (through Sempione Park) or a 15 minute tram ride (tram tickets are available from Reception).There are several bars and restaurants within a 5 minute walk from the hotel and my daughter and I felt perfectly safe walking back from these after dark.The Lancaster Hotel certainly exceeded our expectations and we were particularly impressed with the way that the staff were so welcoming.

It is a small hotel and older building but the decor is up to date and quite modern. Rooms are clean and well kept and a good size for a city hotel, they were well maintained and the bathroom was modern and looked if it had been recently upgraded. As a first time visiter who does not speak Italian, the staff were very helpful in pointing out the location of all the tourist places to visit and drew them clearly on a map. Restaurants and bars were a short walk away and plentiful, they were also less expensive than the ones in the city centre. You can walk into the city centre thru the park with the big arch which takes probably 45 mins although it took us longer as there was a market it the bottom end of the park around the castle. The other option we used was a tram either a 19 or a 1 gets you there.

354,"Stayed there for 4 nights in November. A pleasant small hotel with attractive pricing for Milan. Important to note: it's not centrally located, about 1/2 an hour walking distance from the Duome, more suitable for a business trip when proximity to the downtown is needed. Some may not like pass through the park on their way to the center in darkness, with groups of suspicious youngsters spread over the scenery (there are mixed police/military patrols there during these hours).The staff is very polite, pleasant and helpful, I really liked them. There was an issue with the room when we arrived in the middle of a night, but the receptionist resolved it quickly. The breakfast was good and well-served.But I would suggest to pay more attention to the maintenance. Our room could be kept in a little better condition, especially the bathroom. The same is about the staircases and the carpets covering them.To summarize everything: good for 3 stars and the price I paid in generally expensive Milan, but if you wish to be in the heart of the city, it's probably worth to pay extra and go to a more central hotel.

I was travelling solo and sort of a bit nervous but the vibe of the hostel was great, everyone was welcoming and it was pretty easy to meet people in the common areas and your room. The staff are friendly and the rooms are super clean and even have a en-suite which I was pleasantly surprised at. The hostel also really respects not making noise after hours so if you wanted to rest it was super easy to. I would definitely stay here again ","September 12, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

361,This place is great and can honestly say I have no complaints. It has the best staff and atmosphere for any hostel I’ve been to in Europe so could not recommend enough. Location wise it’s about a 25 minute walk from the centre but can be done much quicker on public transport. Don’t usually review on trip advisor but felt I had to for this place. ,"September 3, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

362,"A fantastic hostel to stay in. 10/10 for every single aspect. Incredible atmosphere and everybody is very friendly. Exceptionally clean and comfortable. Free breakfast and dinner was wonderful. An event every night ensures the atmosphere is always buzzing and vibrant. Despite staying on the first floor directly above the bar there was not a single sound to disturb a nights sleep. Air conditioning in the rooms is fantastic and rare for a hostel. Ensure to make the most of the free drink upon arrival, 6th floor balcony and ask the staff for literally anything as they are there to help you with whatever you may have to ask.","September 3, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

We were given a free welcome drink and offered free breakfast which is excellent for the price per night. The rooms were clean, spacious and there was plenty of storage/lockers.

Breakfast and dinner included was a luxury I definitely was not expecting! Location is brilliant for all kinds of travelors to Milano. The outdoor area and roof terrace is also a lovely spot to relax on a summer day/evening. I'd also like to extend my sincere gratitude to the staff for helping me with both packing my bike down into a box and helping carry it to the bus shuttle for my flight out of Milano.

372,"Nightmare! I'm not really sure where to start with this review.. I had a terrible experience in Ostello Bello Grande and highly recommend you look for another option (madama hostel, cheaper airbnb). - Upon checking in at 3pm, I was told the room was not ready as a group of 100 had just checked out so had to wait for the room to be ready (so I didn't get to explore my first day) - Upon getting to my room it had more the vibe of a jail cell than a hostel room with a strong overpowering smell of cheap cleaning products. - The smell was so overpowering I had to go to a supermarket and buy multiple air fresheners - Dirty walls with a single bed beside up against the wall, I moved the bed to the middle of the room so I didn't touch the walls - Dried snot on the wall above my bed ( I had to pick off the wall, seriously) - Under the beds they have insect catchers so they obviously have problems with bugs. - no activities to help you meet other travellers - made the previous hostel I stayed at look like a palace (madama hostel) - paying over 120 euro per night, I went to the bar and was refused ice because I wasn't buying a drink, female bar tender gave me the worst look I've ever seen every time I passed the bar - so of course I had to avoid it my entire trip. A girl proceeded to go behind me and got 2 glasses of ice by flirting with the bar tender - a staff member tried to charge one of the guests 20 euro for entry to a free nightclub - one hostel staff gloated about kissing 2 girls in the same room and proceeded to make a girl cry by trying to hit on her. He was fired because of this but obviously no vetting process for the staff - asked one of the receptionists how to go to lake Como: her helpful reply, ""check the website or the station it's easy to go to Como station"" I checked online and they said don't go to Como station, go to vareena, a much more picturesque town. - Asked one of the staff where the nearest supermarket was, she said she didn't know - I walked outside and there was one next door. - They frequently have large groups of school children staying; I had multiple labeled items stolen from the fridge - run down shower / bathroom barely fitted in it - 1 small towel for a 4 night stay - No freezer in the shared kitchen - Slow almost unusuable WiFi in the rooms at night , gets faster when people are exploring during the days and in common spaces - another group of 100 school children checked in my final night. I was woken at 7am to the sounds of screaming children running and chasing eachother (at night too) - walls very thin, you hear conversations in other rooms - for breakfast they serve awful cheap German sausages and eggs like rubber - dinner is another story; pasta and crisps - due to the huge amount of school children all the common areas were taken up by them shouting and screaming. - had another friend who was completely destraught as she couldn't find anywhere to work, study or sleep while she waited for her flight Do NOT stay in a single private room as there are much better options in Milan, if you are looking for the social side you can still experience that by coming to their bar open to locals. If you can get this for under 25 euro per night it's acceptable because Milan is expensive and this provides the basics, my frustration comes from the fact I was paying over 125 per night for the same service. I would have cancelled the momment I got to my room but they don't allow refunds - I'll be waiting for some form of refund after this review. I don't want to leave a bais review , so I'll mention the good things too; the AC in the room was very cold, kitchen topped up with fresh fruit daily, nice rooftop chillout area (but no view), some of the staff were very nice, cleaning staff very friendly and those doing works around the place.","July 8, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

375,"I've seen some reviews saying the staff are unfriendly but I found this hostel to offer quite the contrary. You're greeted upon entering with the friendly reception staff who advised on the local sights and metro links to get around. The rooms are spacious enough for a hostel, I liked that the storage was under the beds which meant there was no need to throw a suitcase/rucksack into a high up locker as seen in other hostels. I stayed in a 6 bed shared dorm, the bed was comfy and pillows and bedding were clean. The roof terrace is a great space to relax in an evening and has nice views over some of Milan. Lots of guests up there having a good time at night so if you want a hammock you have to get there early in the evening. Dinner and breakfast were provided free of charge (included in the price) and were pretty good. Dinner runs 7-9pm and consisted of pasta and a few other dishes. You also get a free drinks coupon when checking in which is a really nice touch. Upon eating breakfast the following morning a girl was playing the communal piano which was very nice to chill out to. They have a great set up at this hostel that allows guests to choose the experience they want. Some quiet areas and some more communal areas.

376,"I arrived in the morning and was well received by the staff.However, at night, after having walked all day and having around 5 hours until I had to wake up, I was received by a guy around 9pm who mistreated me and was very unfriendly. All because he didn't hear me saying ""Hi"" when I arrived (which I did say by the way). He is in no way prepared to deal with guests and the public. Not only was he being unreasonably unfriendly, he complained that I arrived with a pizza, insisted that I had to pick up my luggage immediately (even though I just wanted to have 15 minutes to eat my pizza before going to my room) and refused to look into the schedule of the shuttle to Bergamo airport, saying he didn't have it (even if there was a big computer screen in front of him). That really made my stay (of one single night) really stressful and unpleasant.When I woke up and went to the reception around 3 am for a cup of coffee and checkout, there was another guy and he was nice.I cannot complain about the accommodation and the installations.You should definitely talk to that guy. It's not right to treat anyone like he did. I tried to avoid any confrontation whatsoever because all I wanted was to eat my pizza and go to bed. If I had more time in Milan, I would've switched hostels. ","June 19, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

The Recption guy Dado was awesome! He is super cool and so friendly, i think he is the best Receptionist i have ever met haha.They have a nice bar with variety of beers and drinks with good price range. The bartender Zoe is very cute and friendly as well .The hostel guests were very nice people! I really love them. I made a lot of friends there in two nights only and it was my birthday and we celebrated together, it was an amazing experience.There are also some Italian people come to sit in the bar area to socialize with foreigners and practice English.The hostel is super clean actually, for me it was as clean as a good 4 stars hotel, especially the common areas like the bathroom, it was very clean all the time.They have free breakfast and dinner, it’s a good value for money saving if you’re traveling on budget. They had an event the night I arrived, there was like a band playing guitar and singing, that was pretty awesome.The hostel is only 3 minutes walking from the central station in milan (milano centrale) , and there’s a supermarket next to it , and some good restaurants as well.I really enjoyed my stay there and i will stay in this hostel again if i come back to milan , and i will also recommend it for my friends when they go to milan.

387,"Its location is unbeatable, literally steps away from Milano Centrale Station. There’s free breakfast and dinner every day, and oh, a welcome drink of your choice (beer / coffee). The hostel organises events almost daily, so there’s something different to look forward to every day, if you’re looking to get involved as much as possible – e.g. soccer nights, KTV, live music performances, etc. There’s also a really chillax spot at the rooftop lounge, with hammocks and tables & chairs so you could relax there with a book or do your own stuff on your laptop. There’s also a games room and smaller, more cosy & quieter lounge you can access in the basement to escape from the mayhem on the bar area / ground floor. BUT, be warned that it's a party hostel!!! (I’m sure this counts as a plus for many people) And because it's a party hostel, it tends to attract a certain profile of people to stay there. Young, outgoing, lively, energetic and obviously, party animals. Ten years ago, this could be my best place to stay. I love to meet and interact with people from different nationalities, and hang out till late at night, talking or drinking. But, now that I'm slightly older, I actually appreciate more personal time, and also sleep. Sleep is something that you won't be getting much if you stay in this hostel, because it's very likely that you will have someone coming in very late at night after a night of drinking and partying. One guy in my room always came back after midnight, and as his bed is on the topmost deck, he never fails to wake everyone up just by entering the room, opening the lockers, climbing up to his bed, or down to pee. I’m just glad I got assigned to a bed on the bottom deck, and NOT on the top deck (which is 3 levels up – i.e. three tiers of beds!!!) The noise from downstairs can sometimes be heard when the music / people get too loud. So, all things considered, this is a great place to stay (check out the row of awards from Hostelworld.com at the check-in counter!!!) if you're looking to meet people and make friends, and if you're young and looking for love. I won't recommend this hostel for families or people who appreciate a little more peace and quiet. I found the room to be very cramped. I mean, you have 6 people staying in a room, in which half the space is taken up by the triple decker beds. Another one-third is taken up by the gigantic metallic lockers. There’s no table in the room – because obviously there’s no space for one, not even a tiny one. And only one chair. Like, I don’t understand the hostel design. Surely, you can have more space-efficient solutions for the luggage, and actually free up space for more furnishings.","May 7, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

This place amazed me from the first step in.Very friendly crew, which makes you feel welcomed and home immediately,Very clean, there is always a cleaning group available,Very cosy furnished, pillows were most comfy ones I got, even compared to 5 star hotels! Bunks are very stable.WiFi works amazingly everywhere, even at 6th floor!Witty wall stickers and quotes can crack you up unexpectedly and you will be even warned for rules with humor. Very peace-/respectful, I think I haven’t seen any person with a sulky face, even from crew itself,People would say it’s a noisy hostel but hey, they give you FREE earplugs among many other things as portable charger, network, laptops, umbrella, guitar, anything. Just ask for it! Keep it in mind you are 2 minutes away from the heart of the city and not on swiss mountains. The main benefit is, you can easily make friends here. The hostel arranges FREE walking tours and there is always an activity each day, which allows you to interact with people. If it’s too much for you, try the Chill Room, Garden or Rooftop. They are very comfortable and you ll feel recharged. This place recycles organic waste, how bad can they be?

I was impressed by their customer service. The staff was very welcoming and approachable. They give you a free drink, snacks, and breakfast. They had an aperitivo, but I was not there for it. The cornetti during snack service are so so good! I was disappointed that they were not included at the breakfast. The breakfast was a nice amenity, but nothing special. Eggs, hot dogs, bread, yogurt, cereal. Overall I would highly recommend for budget travelers! It makes the city very accessible for people at any means. The hostel is very social. I was there on a Sunday night and when I walked into the lobby if felt like a crowded bar.

391,"Very nice atmosphere and helpful staff. A bit noisy though because of partying teenagers running in the corridors, slamming doors and shouting. We were on the second floor which contained also doorms with several beds. Maybe it would be more calm to have a room on a floor higher up in the building.

392,"At first we chose this hostel because of location, just few mins walk from the central train station!!! However, this little gem had enlighten our day and we actually did a “tour”! Haha just feels so cool compared to the hostels that we have stayed before! Probably my 2nd favorite hostel in Europe (my top favorite is a hostel in St.Moriz, Switzerland!!).....Nice kitchen, nice outdoor patio, nice room, and very good hospitality! Highly recommended!","April 1, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

393,"I have just left after spending 2 nights here. The hostel is literally a 2 minute walk away with the main station and the underground. On arrival the staff were really lovely and gave me some tips on what to see and not do in the city. There’s a free walking tour everyday at 3pm but unfortunately I didn’t go on it because I went to Lake Como instead. You get a free drink voucher to use at the bar and a free map of the city. I’d opted for a single private room and was very happy with it. The bathroom was small but adequate and you got some free toiletries. The bed was comfortable but it has a metal frame so be careful because I banged my head on it in the night. There was also coat hangers, a dressing room table and a bed side light. I went to bed really early one the first night and was worried I’d be kept up with the noise all night. This wasn’t the case and didn’t hear anything about around 10.30. This was on the third floor. The breakfast was good for a free hostel breakfast and was plenty of bread, James, sausages, scrambled eggs, cereal, juices and coffee each morning. I can’t comment on the evening meal because I opted it go to a restaurant instead with me only being there 2 nights. The food looked basic but plenty of pasta, beans and pulses and pizza squares. I had a look around and the terrace on the top floor was very big. I wanted to spend more time in the bar but I was that tired from by exploring in the day I only had 1 or 2 drinks each night. If I was to go back to Milan I would definitely stay here. ","March 25, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

When i arrived i received a free drink and the breakfast was free and healthy. The location is amazing since its only 2 min walking from the central station and its only 15 min walking to the Duomo church.

396,"My review is totally based off on a personal experience (taking into account all the other worldwide hostels where I have been to), so it could not be shared by someone else, fair enough - however I do not understand the excellent reviews given by the other guests. Have you ever been to an EXCELLENT hostel before? What is your criteria when giving 5*? I think these are given out too much easily and I will explain you why:First off : check-in: slow. Upon my arrival I had to wait 15 mint to be checked in as both receptionists were busy but so slow. Friendliness is ok but sometimes you gotta speed it up, especially when you see there are people (tired) in the queue.On the good side, the guys were pretty kind and keen on helping out with any request.Room: I’d booked a 5-bedded room, made up of 2 bunk beds so one would be with 3 beds on top of each other, I was on the top one. The room itself is pretty small and there is no curtains for privacy ( 5 star hostels should definitely have them).There’s a little light, socket and a small basket next to each bed.Lockers and padlock are provided. I don’t know about the other rooms but mine had a private bathroom, although this is a great feature, I strongly believe sharer bathroom/showers should be available outside the room since one bathroom for 5 pax is not enough, especially in the morning when we have to take turns, but that’s not the case, there is no shared facilities.The worst part was the noise. The room was on the first floor right next to the street... I couldn’t sleep a wink. Make sure to ask for a room located on the other side of the building.Breakfast: 5 items and that’s it. Some eggs,wustel,bread,cornflakes,milk that’s it.I’ve been to hostels providing a breakfast that could be compare to some luxury hotels. You’re supposed to offer a wider selection of food, given that you are ranked as the top hostel in town.Another thing I notice is that this place is packed out with Italians, on a typical Fri/Sat night. That’s because drinks are cheap and so they’d only come here for drinking and loudly shouting (that’s why you can’t sleep).I am sorry but it was all very disappointing and people need to know the truth.","February 9, 2019","8    Ostello Bello Grande

402,"(31 male from Israel) Spent a couple of nights in a dorm late Oct. 2018. Very friendly and helpful staff, easy check-in/out process. Easy access hostel from main train station (and therefore also from airport). Arriving you receive a free drink. Breakfast as well as dinner are included and very nice! Many, lounge areas, useful facilities and options to rent any forgotten accessory (towel, padlock etc.).Only downside the entire stay was during my second and last night where one of the hostel guests made horrible noise, shouting, running up and down the hostel as well as in and out, sounding the fire alarm, etc. this continued until breakfast, where he arrived shirtless and drunk, annoying the rest of the guests. Sadly, the staff did nothing to stop this!","November 30, 2018","8    Ostello Bello Grande

The beds and linens I had were clean and didn’t show any stains. The showers were small but the water pressure was great. Overall, the rooms were standard and well-kept.It is located extremely close to Milano Centrale and the Metro station there which makes getting around very easy. They have fun activities every night (Karaoke was a big party) plus breakfast and dinner and a full bar. The food is average, but it works in a pinch and saves you money.

407,"In many ways a typical hostel. No luxury, except for the rooftop terass on a sunny day, but very well planned and organized. Amazing that breakfast and dinner is included in the price, and a welcome drink. The bar is a real bar that also attracts local students. Informational signs everywhere reminding people of basic things (so many are ignorant of such). Great kitchen on a separate floor from the dining and pub area. Very good vibes here and definitively one of the best.

On the train to Milan, I decided to look for places to spend the night instead of heading straight to the airport. That's when I stumbled upon this gem. What a good decision it was... I got a twin room for a very affordable price. After a short walk across form Milano Central, I arrived at the hostel to be welcomed by three very friendly front desk staff. They made me feel at home immediately. The check in process was breeze and the room was absolutely awesome. Clean, nice decor, balcony, quiet, comfortable. The bar area with free food and a free beer was a nice perk. The garden in the back was very nice and so was the game room in the basement. This place is everything that a hotel can never be and then some. I highly recommend this place to everyone visiting Milan.

I asked where I could buy some toiletries and they provided me with some for free which lasted my whole 8 day trip. Bonus!The free breakfast and evening meal were great value - plenty of choices and very filling. On an evening the bar area was very social . I enjoyed chatting to people from all over the world and was nice to have interaction with being solo. The bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and had everything you needed - charging points, light and storage at side of bed as well as huge draw under the beds. I had my own padlock but you could use one of the hostels if you didn't have one. The only thing I would say is I can't remember if I saw a plug socket in the room for straightening hair or anything like that other than the bed sockets. Towels were provided which was fab.Location was perfect as 5 minute walk to the train station and a 25 minute walk into centre of Milan.I've already recommended this place to friends and would happily return here again :) thank you!

423,"Our family of 4 used this property as our ""home in Italy"" for our summer vacation/holiday. It is very very convenient to Milano Centrale train station which is incredibly well connected such that you can take non-stop high speed trains everywhere. The area is a mix of urban/residential feel and is just perfect. If you want to go into the city center of Milan, the metro is also very convenient. Lots of restaurants, shops, stores, everything you would need very close by. Most importantly, the management and staff at this hotel treat you like family and go way out of their way to ensure you have everything you need including fantastic recommendations and arrangements. For example, Franceso really took his time to setup a private pasta making class which was customized to be vegetarian for us and at a five star hotel for a very reasonable price. The experience was amazing. He also took a call from me at 3am when our car service did not arrive and we were worried because of tight timing for an international flight, and worked things out and we made it no problem. That is amazing service. Michael is also excellent and helped us in so many ways. We had a family apartment which was extremely clean and comfortable for a family of four. We ate out a lot but a few nights we got take away and ate at the kitchen table and it felt like home. They also have a nice gym which I took advantage of many mornings, both weights and cardio equipment. The lobby also makes it feel like your home every time you come in. There is an espresso machine you can use anytime, also some cookies/biscuits, and there is a fridge from which you can take water bottles at your convenience as if it were your own.

430,"Let me start by saying that the property is more like apartments but they are large and nicely furnished and well appointed.We were welcomed by Francesco, who was extremely nice and very professional.The location of the property is 7-10min walk from the entrance to the central station and is primarily in a residential area between two busy roads.The room has a stove, fridge and microwave.The room and bathroom were very clean and well presented.My only issue was the temperature of the room was not in the control of the guest. My room was 26 degrees Celsius all night but the air outside was not hot and there was no way to operate the air conditioner or reduce the heat.Francesco explained to us this was outside of his control due to regulation and the whole property was like this so he offered to circulate the air. This did nothing and the fan was not operational. He offered to move is to another property or open windows in the room. As the alternative property was not in a location I needed I opted to try and sleep in the room.The room was still too hot with the windows open (still 26C) and extremely noisy and we were unable to sleep at all. We opted to leave the property the next morning extremely tired.Francesco was very professional and asked us not provide a negative review.This is my honest response and review of this property so please consider this as constructive Francesco . I travel a lot for my job and live in hotels 60% of my year.This is a nice property and the staff are very good. However the heat to me in the room was excessive. It is not the heat of Milan as I live in the Middle East without issues.Please address the problem with the air and you will have an ideal property. There may be a restriction on providing cool air but the heat needs to be turned off or controllable. If a guest is unable to sleep then this is fundamental.It is the only thing that would stop me returning. Thank you Francesco for your support and professionalism but please rectify this as it is spoiling your property.","April 9, 2019","9    Residenza delle Citta

We were upgraded to a suite with a 2nd floor loft, it would be great for a big group or a family. The whirlpool tub was fantastic. There was a heated towel rack and the toiletries were so very cute. We only stayed 1 night and we're trying to get over the jet lag of coming from US. The windows had great blackout curtains!!! They have a very small parking lot which we were able to park in.Downsides: The hallways are beautiful marble but they echo.The blow dryers in the room aren't the best quality, bring your own if you have longer hair. And the bath is beautiful, but it comes with a handheld wand you have to hold over your head to shower. This is probably normal in Europe, and was more of an issue for my bf who is tall.","March 4, 2019","9    Residenza delle Citta

Lots of windows let in plenty of light but there were sheer curtains for privacy. The front gate was locked at night so I felt secure. My door key fitted the front door so if I had wanted to stay out later I could get in with no problem. The person on the front desk was able to give me directions and information about transport around Milan. He also made recommendations about what to see. It was perfect for me travelling alone but a couple would find it comfortable as well. Only 10 minutes walk from the railway station it was very convenient. There was a supermarket close by and a great selection of restaurants as well.

When an attempt was made to lock the wheel on the bed leg, the whole leg came off the bed. The beds are extremely firm.

Friendly staff, clean room, wonderful view of the back garden are compiling the fantastic image I got from this hotel. The only minus I found, it was the old bathtub that needs renovation/trnasformation to a shower. If it is in your budget range, you should give it a try.

Friendly and courteous, helpful staff. Very nice facility, great breakfast, beautiful backyard. Fairly close to major city centers in Milan.

However, having paid almost 400euros for a night, I expected a bit better, without expecting a luxury hotel. On the pictures attached (taken April 2019), you will find a hair dryer which I had not seen in any hotel rooms for many years, as well as a thin plastic bathtub which was very difficult to hop on in, although I am a skinny person!

We arrived, checked in and then headed out for the church. The staff was helpful in giving us directions to the church, but we did get a little lost. The hotel is very beautiful. When you walk in to the lobby you see a lovely view of the green lawn in a park setting through a big picture window. The lobby has a reading room and guest computer area. The hotel was very quiet on a side street away from major traffic. Our room was very clean and had also had a big picture window which faced out to the street and some lovely apartment houses across the road.

The hotel itself is functional but rather utilitarian. That said, the staff is wonderful. They were so helpful to us & had a great command of English. Francesco at reception was especially helpful and professional. We also liked the breakfast and the young women who served us cappucinos and refilled the buffet. They also gave us good recommendations on things to do in Milan. Like I said, do not expect a 5-star hotel room by any means, but our room was clean and functional. Also, the neighborhood is a very attractive residential neighborhood with a lot of small, leafy apartment buildings, restaurants, and some supermarkets.

Breakfast was also good (with the exception of one morning where the eggs really tasted like powdered eggs), but the variety of items offered are terrific. I would think there is a little bit of something for every taste.The beds were comfy, and the room is well appointed. The metro is literally a one or two minute walk. There is a shopping center maybe a 10 minute walk one direction and the other has a market area. There are ATM'S (bankomat) close by.The restaurant across the street has pretty decent food.The only caution for our trip was some stupid chicks tried to pick-pocket my husband on the metro-escalator. A. We learned along time ago, you don't leave valuables in a back pocket or side cargo pocket. B. Always be aware who is touching you n where. C.

The cleaning person had entered to our room where there are some valuable things in the room. Although there was no missing thing, it was not comfortable and was unacceptable. We have asked the front person but they said that: if you do not need room cleaning you need to tell the front person specifically everyday!

540,"The hotel is very functional. Well located. 12 minutes from the station. By the metro station. Or walking distance from the Duomo.Although small, the room is comfortable, clean and well equipped. It has all amenities even if the safe is too small (you cannot fit a PC or a camera inside). You can count on the front desk if you miss anything. The bed is comfortable.The staff is very helpful and warm. From the lobby to the restaurant no forgetting the bar.The breakfast is a typical buffet with a large variety of choice. If you need a particular hot drink, you can order it as well.The Spa is very nice to relax after a day of walking. Even if the guests do not really respect the silence, it remains a cool place with a warm water, sauna and hammam. We felt that the hamman needs some cleaning.A rooftop terrace is nice place for a drink at sunset, but it is a pity that there are 2 big advertisement signs spooling the view.The reason for your 1 star is that despite all the above, we had 3 problematic nights and this is because of the very poor noise insulation. The rooms are designed so that the bathroom of one is back to the bedroom of the other: a major design flow. Moreover, there is no noise insulation: the second design flow. BW would have given up one or 2 rooms per floor, they could have had a very modern insulation. We ended up hearing everything from the next room: the TV, the water of the shower, the splashed of the bath, the shaving of the morning. The first night our neighbor that decided to take a bath just before 7am waked us up.The second night, 3 woman sharing few rooms in our floor decided to have a gathering the room next to ours. We had to go and ask them to lower the noise level before the baby wakes up.The icing of the cake was the last night where the family next door decided to have shower at 2am. They did not open nor reply when we tried to knock on their door or wall. We had to call in the lobby who had to negotiate for about 30 minutes.It is clear that the incivility of the people is not the responsibility of the hotel. But it is clear that would BW choose to spend more money in the insulation and the architect put bathroom back to back between rooms we would have avoided these problems and the nightmare of the last night. I must also say that I was particularly disappointed by the reply I got over the phone by the second staff at the front desk who pretended that they can not call the police and I can use my own phone.If noise is important to you, then this place is not for you. Otherwise, it is a functional place for a weekend or a business trip. For us it is a never again.","August 28, 2019","11    Best Western Plus Hotel Galles

566,"Why no one mentioned that the metro is passing just under the hotel and some rooms will have the vibration.The first room we had , the vibration was so much we could not tolerate, then we were moved to fifth floor which you could still feel it when you lay on the bed but it was ok. I am not sure, if I had to stay in the first room, it could be the worse hotel but the second one was good. Most of us are traveling from overseas and already so exhausted from the airport and the plan, we choose the best western and a four star hotel to make sure we will be comfortable and it will have the standards but a vibrating room is NOT expected. Changing the room again got more energy out of me and time. ","June 25, 2019","11    Best Western Plus Hotel Galles

575,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights at the B and B in early June. Our flight was delayed and we had been texting Norma, the owner, to keep her up to date as to our arrival. Communication was always very prompt, whether it was via email as we were planning our trip, or with text messaging when we were in Milan. Her husband, Giampaolo, would be picking us up at the airport, eliminating the need to hire a private car. He was waiting for us after we gathered our luggage and we travelled to the B and B in their van. The location is in a country setting and is more than just the B and B. The family lives on the grounds, but not in the B and B. Everything is nicely maintained. There are several dogs, but they are all well behaved and did not enter the B and B. It’s a comfortable family environment. We were met by Norma, who greeted us warmly. There were the occasional language issues, since we don’t speak any Italian. However, Google translator did the trick for each of us. We had several entertaining moments communicating and that added to the enjoyment of our visit. Giulia, their oldest daughter, spoke very good English and acted as a translator as needed.Norma, Giampaolo and their family couldn’t have been any nicer or more hospitable. They really went the extra mile. Since we arrived late and jet lagged, Norma made us something light to eat. Breakfast each day in the large country kitchen was always more than we could eat and always ready to meet our schedule. There is a bus that stops right outside the B and B and the local Metro station at Bisceglie makes for an easy trip into Milan. On a few occasions, Norma and Giampaolo were kind enough to drop us at the Metro station. We also used a taxi from the B and B to get into the city. The house itself is initially deceiving. Once settled in, we noticed how well-appointed things were. Many antiques throughout really add a home like atmosphere. We stayed in the Green Room and were very comfortable. The bathrooms are all very modern and well designed. The air conditioning worked well as we were there during unseasonal heat. There was also a balcony that opened to the courtyard area. The entire location was very quiet.A final example of excellent customer service actually occurred after we left. We were traveling by train from Milan to Venice and then to Rome and didn’t want to carry all of our luggage with us, so we planned to ship it via Express Courier to our location in Rome. Since we were leaving on a Saturday, and the shipper was closed, Giampaolo offered to take the luggage on Monday to have it shipped. He even wrapped it in plastic for protection and it arrived safely two days later in Rome. Definitely went above and beyond.We left Norma and Giampaolo with warm hugs and fond memories. We would definitely stay here again.","July 14, 2019","12    B&B Atmosfera di Stagione

Nice grounds and very good breakfast when we had the time to eat. This is the kind of B&B we enjoy. Family run and it's their home. Kids doing homework, friends coming by. Just a warm home and warm hospitality. The only thing I would change if I were them is payment method. We were on our way out to get the car back and instead of using the credit card on file I had to set up a PayPal account and then use my credit card.

They were so super helpful and Guilia their daughter has excellent english skills. You will love Norma's breakfast. Fantastic. Fresh baking every day. Our room was lovingly appointed with ensuite. Very clean and a nice balconey overlooking their courtyard. On arrival we had drinks and then they took us and another couple downtown to the Grande Canal district for dinner and a tour arround.

591,"Atmosfera di stagione is a unique self-contained compound in the Muggiano district of Milan, sheltered from the rather ordinary surrounding apartment blocks, which is a testament to the individualism and creativity of the Nicoli family: Norma, Giampaolo, and their daughters. The guest rooms (we stayed in the Camera Verde) are designed and fitted out to the highest standards, luminous and impeccably clean, with spacious bathrooms and more than comfortable beds. Our breakfasts changed daily and, with Norma's homemade pastries and jams, and surprises like fresh fruit in yogurt, cheese and prosciutto, were worthy of a Michelin star. We have stayed in many nice B&Bs, especially in Italy, but the artistry and extra attention we experienced here were unique.We drove from the airport and kept our rental car in the enclosed private parking area. This turned out to be a good decision as it allowed us to get back and forth conveniently from the metro station, where parking is very inexpensive.

Private enclosed parking space within the property. We drove, so it was not too difficult to find the location with the help of GPS. To avoid the traffic in Milan city, Norma sent us to the Metro station which is 5 mins away, otherwise, there's a straight bus (about 15mins ride) and connect via Metro to Milan city center(less than 30mins).

But the owners make up for that by helping you out literally wherever possible and getting you from bisceglie or taking you there. If you are travelling by car, you won't have that issue and in any case it's a highly recommendable b&b.

I would definitely recommend this hotel. If you like cats there is a cat cafe across the road which serves delicious fruit sundae’s,"August 8, 2019","13    Hotel Mediolanum Milan

606,"First off a quick run down of why this hotel is so good. 1. Value for money2. Location - short walk from the train station and a pleasant walk through the park to the city centre3. Great staff4. Plentiful and varied breakfast 5. Nice rooms and general areas6. Some good local restaurants7. Great local bar ‘the monkey bar’Now some detail. The hotel does not cost the earth for what you get. The location is great if don’t mind a stroll, if you want to walk out straight into the tourist hotspots this is not the place, but you’ll not get the price either. The staff were brilliant providing us with invaluable information about the local area and how to get to the lakes. The rooms are great, we had a deluxe one and would recommend paying the extra. Ask for one with a walk in shower and it will be even better. The general areas are clean and quirky also. The restaurants in the local area are good also, although most of the restaurants in Milan are great. The local bar is not to be missed if you like a cocktail, especially if you are opened minded and don’t quite know what you want. All in all this is great option and would not hesitate in going back.

608,"I hope this information helps.Booked this hotel for 3 reasons: Price, Distance from Central Station and positive reviews and I believe I nailed it.Just got back from 3 days in Milan with Hubby and it met all expectations. The price was on the lower end but within 10 minutes walk of the station. We arrived by shuttle from the airport at the side of the station so to find the hotel, walk to the front -the big apple sculpture on the right, if you look straight on you will see the sign for the Just Hotel , head towards this and keep going down this road. You have a restaurant on the corner, pass and walk road between this and Miscusi Restaurant. You will see sign for the hotel -you need to take the next left and its on your left.So having mentioned the great service, Pasquale via email arranged a birthday surprise for my husband - a birthday bottle of bubbly and a cake from local bakers -lovely - tried to eat the whole cake but even we admitted defeat. Eitherway we were treated very well by all staff, even lent us a plug adaptor when ours refused to work and called us a taxi ( 35 Euros and arrived within a couple of minutes to get to Linate airport.) All staff were polite and can't thank them enough.Our room 210, was spacey, bathroom was fairly big and the bed very comfy, we had a fridge and kettle which made early mornings much easy.Breakfast was great, a good variety and definitely saves cash for you to spend on ice cream later.About the trains/underground - to buy underground tickets you need to go into the station, go down to metro level and find newsagent who sell the tickets. 1 euro 50 each way. Very easy. We also bought our other rail tickets to Lake Como and Tirano ( for Bernina Express) on line as its very easy and you just print out your tickets - no need to exchange - the ticket collectors are happy when you show them the printed copy.One more thing, there is a ATM just around the corner - You'll pass it on way to hotel.I think that's it and it might be helpful.Thanks Hotel Mediolanum and its staff!Caz and Martin","May 31, 2019","13    Hotel Mediolanum Milan

611,"The hotel was less than 10 minutes walk from the central station. I found the location very safe, quiet, and convenient as it was surrounded by many stores and restaurants. Check in and check out were fast. My room was ready by 12:00 noon, so I was allowed to check in early. The hotel had elevators -- very small but they served their purpose.I stayed in a single room for three nights. The room was small but the space was well utilized to accommodate a wide bed (wider than I expected for a single room) that’s very comfortable at the same time. It had a mini-bar, electric kettle, desk, chair, safe, flat screen tv, and mirrors. The room was painted in bright, invigorating colors. The bed linens were clean and pristine white. Wifi was fast. There were several electric outlets, some conveniently located beside the bed, for simultaneous charging of multiple electronic devices. Lighting was very nice. It was a relief to find that the floors were not carpeted. The bathroom size was okay for one person. However, the shower cubicle was too small even for a small person like me. The towels and bathrobe were pristine white. Basic toiletries were supplied. The room was not soundproofed. I did not have problems with boisterous neighbors the entire time I was there but I did hear the opening and closing of doors and moving of furniture in the other rooms.The buffet breakfast, served at the basement, was surprisingly good – several choices of cold cuts, fruits, breads and pastries, fresh juices, yogurt, cheeses, veggies, eggs, coffee. The staff were very courteous, attentive and efficient. Dishes never ran out as they were immediately replenished and there was always a clean table to occupy every time I went down.Overall, I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. It exceeded my expectations in terms of quality of the room (at very reasonable rates) and staff service.

A bidet has been squished in next to the toilet, and only a smaller person can easily navigate past the oversized basin to use the toilet. The included breakfast was plentiful with lots of options. It was surprisingly quiet at night. All in all, a good choice for a short stopover in Milan if you are travelling by train. If you are staying longer, I would recommend you stay around the Piazza Duomo. It’s a 25 minute walk to Duomo from the Mediolanum.","June 11, 2018","13    Hotel Mediolanum Milan

641,"Good choice for a hotel near Milan Centrale train station. It truly is a seven minute walk from the station, but the trick is to have excellent directions or that seven minutes can escalate real fast. Clean room with a comfy queen bed, mini fridge, safe. Not sure if it was me, but I would question the air conditioning at night as the room did get warm. As for the breakfast, go hungry, leave stuffed. Decent restaurants in the neighborhood.

We had a pleasant 20min walk into the city centre. The staff were all welcoming friendly and helpful. The rooms were colourful, comfortable and clean. I loved the colourful quirkiness of the place. The breakfasts served in the cosy breakfast room were excellent. My only minor criticism was that we needed to keep asking for milk and tea bags as these didn’t seem to get topped up. But once asked for they were provided promptly. I would recommend the hotel. And don’t forget to sample the jelly sweets on the reception desk - very fruity! I would also recommend the restaurant ‘Jumping’ just over the road. We had a great meal there. ","May 31, 2018","13    Hotel Mediolanum Milan

The coffee with breakfast was amazing. It’s true what they say about Italian coffee - wherever you go it’ll be great!The room was comfortable and adequately sized, but the ensuite could be a little bigger as the toilet was right up against the wall, with barely enough leg room in front so if you’re tall you may have to sit sideways.

650,"We have enjoyed a 4 night stay at this hotel in order to attend a wedding and to do some sight seeing. We have been exceptionally pleased with many aspects of the hotel. It’s location is very convenient. The Lima metro station is just metres from the hotel door. The M1 Metro line connects directly with a number of metro stations next to popular tourist spots e.g. the Museum of Modern Art (w the Duomo and associated features and the impressive Castello. One change on the metro from the M1 on to the M2 takes you directly to the canal area with its many bars, restaurants and market stalls. Metro fares are very reasonable, for all the main areas a 2€ standard ticket lasts for 90 minutes (in zone 1 to 3) and for 7€ a day ticket can be used anywhere in zone 3 any number of times all day. The hotel is close to the central station. A 20 minute walk in a straight line from the station or a five minute taxi (about 8 €) There are also some very nice shops within short walking distance from the hotel. The hotel itself is sparkling clean and our room in the fourth floor was excellent, beautifully furnished and appointed and cleaned scrupulously every morning. Breakfast was good, the usual fruit, yogurt, cheeses, ham, rolls pastries etc etc. There are a number of restaurants and pizzerias nearby for an evening meal including the characterful Piccolo Ischia Pizzeria. Reception staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and well informed. For a weekend break in Milan you can't do better.","August 3, 2019","14    Best Western Hotel City

Another lovely surprise was tea and coffee facility in our room and bottled water. Down at reception there is a coffee machine you can use any time free of charge and a bowl of fruit a nice touch. We were given a welcome drink voucher to use which we did but did not expect all the lovely nibbles to go with it. The choice of red, white or proseco was offered. Breakfast was more than adequate.

Massimo in particular was able to get us booked into a Last Supper Tour at the last minute, something we’d previously given up on after many attempts on websites in the previous couple of weeks. We were thrilled! He also recommended local eateries which turned out to be fantastic, gave us ideas of other places we could visit here and in other parts of Italy, and was patient and fun as we put our limited Italian to the test. The breakfasts were great - lots of healthy and tempting choices with attentive, friendly and staff who reached out to our needs. Kristina willingly made great decaffeinated coffee, the best we’ve ever tasted! Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, and we enjoyed our free welcome drink in the foyer, a lovely way to meet other travellers and visitors to Milan. The lift was an asset for us as senior travellers, and having the Lima Metro station close by was a real bonus, making travel to the Duomo area only minutes away.

Only 100 meters from Subway..Walking distance to some attractions, like Porto Venezia, museums and parks, less than 1.7 km (25 min walk) of center, like Dome, Scala, Galleria...Outside appearance is nice..Modern, blue glass buildings look. Inside, neat, clean and quite, acclimatized, small but effective reception, but with no seating and resting area.. Small but working elevator (1-2 person + luggage), with 7-8 stairs up from reception..(Not convenient if you have heavy luggage or disabled). Very slow, but no long waiting.. Very helpful receptionists, kind stuff. Fast check in..Receptionist kindly gave coupons for complimentary drinks. Very nice on such a hot day.. Thanks Massimo...Rooms are neat, quite and clean, nice looking with all amenities, beside standard, like free Wi-Fi, safe, fridge.. Cold AC was already on..Which made very pleasant and calming experience after outside heat..Complimentary water, coffee, tea, etc.. Cold drinks in fridge are for charge. We were on 6th floor with huge window, street view but inside was quite.Bathroom, in white tiles and clean, plenty of fresh and neatly organized towels, changed daily. Complimentary shampoos and soaps, convenient bide, Couple of cons..No bathroom fan inside..Strange.. And, you know, that might be ""..Naturally unpleasant.."" sometimes..Hair dryer did not work, but no big deal..I could ask for other one.. Floor metal plate was displaced..However I saw renovated bathroom in another room. Cleaning lady said they working slowly on renovation throughout so future guests might enjoy much better new bathrooms. We did not have included Breakfast, so after offered for 3 Euro we accepted. Good deal..Breakfast was fine and worthy of that money. Good breakfast with plenty of food, with something for anyone.I recommend one.Breakfast Room on 1st floor was nice and clean, always neatly settled, not much rush inside. Stuff was neat, clean and uniformed, very kind and with warm greeting when you come and leave.Only thing that bothers me here, Stuff was starting closing too early.They work up to 10, but they start closing at 9:45, cleaning, making noise by bringing out spoons, mugs, glasses, moving around, taking out some of food, making me feel unwanted and bit nervous. If you come late, like I am, your choice of food getting limited. Beside those small cons I had, I would approve 3.5 - 4 stars (because of size, small reception and elevator), but location, comfortable stay of 4 nights, and other things as well as always smiley and helpful stuff made it up and was all right.

The shower fittings were also badly situated - each time you tried to move in the shower, the handle was knocked stopping the water completely.

Overall very clean and breakfast is very good.Best thing about his hotel is the location, in the mid of the busy Corso Buenos Aires, a shopping hub, also it is about 20 min walking to Milano Central Station. There is also a metro stop very near to the hotel. ","August 30, 2017","14    Best Western Hotel City

677,Pros:- excellent location. Easy walking distance from Milan central (both trains and busses from the airport stop there)- Lima metro station a minute away- good location. Lots more of shops and places to eat nearby- breakfast is incredible value at only 3EUR per person per night- spacious clean comfortable and quiet rooms- complimentary welcome drinks and snacks- great service from the staffCons:Nothing to note here.

678,"It takes a hour on the train from the airport to milan central. We walked to the hotel from the central train station and it took about 15 minutes. On arrival were were offered a free welcome drink and given keys to our room on the 4th floor overlooking the road. We did not find the road noisy except for a couple of loud motorcycles. The air con had been on and it was nice and cool. The bed was large and super comfy and room size was as expected with a bathroom with well stocked toiletries. Breakfast was amazing for just £3 each! Lots of choice with a small hot offering. You could not find better in the whole of Milan! You also have free coffee/hot chocolate available in the small bar all day long with free croissants. Reception staff really helpful. The lift is small but we only used it to get our cases up and down to the room. The metro stopped almost outside - the red line - and Lima stop. You can get a full day pass for£4.50 if you wish. We walked everywhere, the cathedral Dumo took us 25 mins and the castle another 10 on top. We walked 13 miles on both the full days we were there. We found that food was a lot cheaper outside of the main tourist areas. One restaurant offered a 1 litre of coke for 18 euros!! As for Milan, well it's not a patch on other cities and not much to see apart from shops and graffiti. The hotel was great and would be happy to recommend but as for Milan, we won't be back in a hurry. Go to Prague, Berlin or Amsterdam, sorry Milan!","August 9, 2017","14    Best Western Hotel City

679,"Selected this hotel based on central location and price.Arrived in Milan in the morning - no problem to have your luggage stored before you can check-in. Hotel itself has no parking you will be directed to a nearby parking garage. about 5 min walking distance.Concierge/Check-in Staff is friendly and helpful. First problem you have to conquer after check in - the elevator - to small for 3 people and luggage, so someone has to walk to the 5 floor. Note the elevator will become a ""bigger problem"" in the morning when everybody goes to breakfast and wants to check out - prepare for some waiting.ROOM - well the first room we got [family room 3 beds] had an A/C problem - water dripping from the sealing - since the elevator was now occupied by cleaning staff - walk down 5 floors, complain - no problemo, hotel staff arranged right away for new rooms. Now we have 2 rooms for the same price - single and double same floor.Checking the air condition -> no sign of operation -> all right, walking all the floors down - complain - explanation power problem will be fixed later. OK - lets first conquer Milan. Coming back in the evening - A/C still not running, new staff downstairs, no idea what i'm talking about - so sorry. Well so much about the A/C for a hot summer night in the city.Breakfast is a bargain for the money paidOverall and with a smile - the hotel is OK for 1 night with no A/CIf you stay longer you want to get this fixed","August 1, 2017","14    Best Western Hotel City

680,"Located on the main shopping street, Corso Buenos Aires, and less than a minute's walk to the Lima stop on the metro red line, the location is really great and you can make your way around the city from this central location. Surrounded by shops, restaurants and bars it was great for going out in the evenings. The breakfast was standard mainland European but was nice and they did have a few hot options to choose from too. The bar/lobby area was small enough but really nice and the service provided by hotel staff was quite exceptional. The elevator is very small (Fits maybe 3 people, or 2 with small suitcases), so most of the time we would take the stairs... Simply because it was quicker than waiting.Also with a street facing room, the traffic noise can be pretty loud when a door or window is open, when closed this wasn't an issue as the soundproofing was really good, we generally used the A/C and had no problems.

681,"Room was quite small but good enough for 2 people to share. Space is not generous in terms of storage and relaxation. Centrally located within shops and close to everything. Plenty of eateries to choose from nearby.Breakfast room was good size. Good service. I would have liked to see an extra water dispenser (i.e. hot water for tea/coffee). There was only one hot drink station and only 2 people could use it at a time. When it got busy there was less supply of hot water. Hot flask readily available for tea on busy times could do the trick. One downside to my stay was I encountered a problem bringing more than 2 people in my room. I had guests reconnecting from childhood days and happened to be living in Milan. I appreciated it may be to do with hotel policy but it was quite of a disappointment as I would have preferred to move less. I was recovering from tiredness and did not want to rush to go out. Simply because my guest and her daughter were not allowed in.We were given a complimentary voucher for a welcome drink to consume whenever we were ready, Which was nice.

685,I rarely find myself having to take to Trip Advisor however after attempting twice to make contact with this hotel after my visit; I am. Nothing wrong with the hotel or general service. Bathroom problems were fixed after a bit of perseverance. Great central location. One of the best breakfasts for the money to be found. However; I urge future guests to check very carefully any taxi arrangements made by or through the hotel; specifically for cost. I'm an experienced traveller but I was still stung when I booked a taxi thro reception and ended up paying almost 4 times the going rate. I've emailed the hotel directly to enquire why I wasn't informed of the excessive charges but no one has replied. If the manager would care to get in touch or reply to both of my emails then I'd welcome that. In the meantime; just check fares and bookings made thro the hotel very carefully.,"May 16, 2017","14    Best Western Hotel City

A jug was provided with ample free tea and coffee (not always a given in parts of Europe!).Breakfast was plentiful.

701,"We stayed here from 3rd to 9th March as part of our 3-wk European holiday/honeymoon. We had chosen to stay here because of its' close proximity to the metro and that it is along one of the bustling streets that has shopping and eateries. It is also a good 20-25 minutes of walk to the Duomo Milan cathedral.The location came up to be one of the best for us.The breakfast selection was average but it wasn't bad. Nothing over the top. They had eggs and a selection of croissants. There were meat too for those non-vegetarian & non-Muslims to enjoy. We don't expect much anyway considering this hotel as one of the budget stays.The room had a very tiny kettle for about 500ml of water which we felt should be upgraded to a 1000ml of kettle. It is rather inconvenient making hot drinks when we have to boil it again & again. The tea & coffee sachets provided for us were certainly useful though.The bed was big enough for the 2 of us, and we slept really well throughout our stay. This is great despite having our rooms facing the street. Our other gripe was that it gets too hot in the room (considering that we are Singaporeans & we come from a country which is generally 30-degC thoughout the year!) and we had to open the balcony doors a few times at night to cool ourselves down. But it's not something that will stop us from selecting to stay in this hotel again if we come to Milan next time.Access to wifi should be improved. We had to constantly request for a ""ticket"" to get a new username/password every 24 or 48 hours during our stay. They don't have the normal free wifi where you access via given username/password once. Best Western may need to look into this. It's quite inconvenient having to keep asking for new ""tickets"" when we are in the middle of planning our trips on our mobile or laptops.Other than the few gripes, it was a lovely and comfortable stay at a convenient location!","March 16, 2016","14    Best Western Hotel City

The room was a modest size, clean and comfortable and had recent been re-equipped. We stayed for 3 nights and each day parts of the hotel became accessible and new furniture appeared. At the end of our stay the reception looked reasonably complete and the basement breakfast room was up and running. All credit to the management, who kept the place running in difficult conditions, they were above and beyond the call of duty to be helpful. When completed this hotel is going to be very nice indeed.

705,"There were a lot of renovation works going on at the hotel which I completely appreciate need doing from time to time however we were disappointed that we were not informed of these works prior to our stay. The reception/lift area and corridor of our floor were left in a total mess by the workmen including tools and a drill being left out, the route to the stairs and fire exit being blocked by some sort of trolley/table and the door to the electrical fuse boxes being left open unattended (see photos). I note that the website references the works ending on 31st Aug (our stay was 4th Sept) and I undersyqnd these things can run over but we received a direct message from the hotel through booking.com a few days prior to our stay to confirm the details and the works were not mentioned here. We also received no acknowledgement or apology from the hotel staff for them. We arrived earlier than check in time and were able to store our bags at the hotel however we found they were left on full show behind the reception desk all day rather than in a secure room as would usually be expected at a hotel. When we arrived later to get the key to room we were told that someone would bring our bags up (after offering to take them ourselves). 20 minutes later they had still not arrived and we had to go and get them ourselves. We were only given one of our bags and when stating that the other bag was also ours there was no check to confirm it actually was and feel that anyone could have said this during the day due to the changeover of staff on reception.The room itself was basic and fairly dated but as you would expect for a cheaper 3 star hotel. It mostly felt clean however there was a hair left on the shower head and a broken plug cover in the shower (see photos). The breakfast room was probably the nicest part we saw of the hotel and the selection of food was average. The location of the hotel is in an area which has quite a few building works going on however it was a good distance from the main square and also the Navigili district where we had dinner.The main positive of our stay which should be noted despite all of the above was the helpful lady who was on reception when we first arrived who gave us a map of Milan and talked us through the main sites and her recommendation of an area for dinner. Hopefully the hotel itself will be much nicer once all of the renovations are completed!","September 9, 2019","15    Hotel Canada Milano

708,"In general, there is nothing to justify the over €100 per day price tag. Some of the furnishing and the air condition are of good quality, but there are also quite a number of poor quality issues (see pictures). The common areas are what I would expect from a hotel with a much lower star rating and price tag. A big problem is Noise. I got repeatedly woken up on the 3rd floor from shouting and banging coming from the street. Forget sleeping in late, the cleaners will start banging and dragging furniture quite early. There seems to be little insulation between floors. When I visited the hotel, they were doing renovations while the hotel was open and guests were there!!! Very loud noises from drilling, cutting metal and banging the walls and floors for most of the day. They refused to move me to another hotel or even change my room. They lied twice about the construction work finishing on the next day. This was unacceptable, I paid over €120 per day to literally stay in a construction site. Even though the staff are helpful and friendly, the hotel management's and especially the ""director's"" attitude was of total disregard for the welfare of the customer.","July 1, 2019","15    Hotel Canada Milano

711,"My husband and I were delighted to be upgraded to a larger room in this small hotel when we checked in during the second week of June. Our five-night stay was pleasant. The front desk staff (no concierge service due to the small size of hotel) was patient with our questions, accommodating with our requests for help with taxis and directions. Breakfast was very good, eggs of two kinds (hard-boiled and scrambled), cold cuts, cheeses, nice array of fruit, breads, cereal, yogurt, etc. Coffee and tea were made to order. A shout-out to the breakfast staff, in particular, Manne, who prepared the coffees and teas and always made sure the guests were taken care of with big smile and warm greetings. The location of Hotel Canada Milano is in walking distance, about 5 minutes to the Crocetta Metro Line, about 20 minute moderate pace walk to the Duomo. For those, who need a pharmacy or mini-mart food, there is an Express store about 75 meters (about half a block; closes at midnight) on the same side of the hotel and another mini-mart for basic food items and other staples on the opposite side of the hotel as Santa Sofia continues around the curve of the block of the hotel. Our room on the backside of the hotel was quiet. The minor downsides of the hotel, which we were told has about 30-something rooms, were (a) single guest elevator, which accommodates about 4 adults. However, since the service elevator was broken, the elevator was also used by the service staff. At times, waiting for the elevator took a while.(b) cleaning staff was not regular with the schedule. We were gone in the morning; by 1 p.m. on three different days, upon return for an afternoon rest from the building heat outdoors, our room had not yet been attended. Room rates were variable. This was not exclusive to Hotel Canada. Since two major events were taking place while we were in Milan, the room rates for some days increased 69% over the rates of other days. It would be a good idea to check out when events like the Men’s Fashion Week is being held. There was also the World Congress event that was held during the week that we were in the city. If one is visiting, it might be prudent to check on major events during the time of visit. This is a no frills, basic three-star hotel. Wonderful and helpful staff, which is a reason, that I’d recommend this hotel to other visitors.","June 18, 2019","15    Hotel Canada Milano

712,"Stayed for only two nights in a triple room. The room was comfortable and typically sized for what we saw in triple rooms throughout our trip. Experience with staff were hit and miss - some seemed indifferent while others (the early evening front desk gentleman in particular) were extremely friendly and eager to offer advice on where to eat, help reserve a car to the airport, etc... Unfortunately the Wifi was terrible. We could connect but it would go in & out making it virtually impossible to rely on. I ended up turning on my international roaming data to get us checked in for our flight out the next day. Also the coffee machine was out of service at breakfast - no espresso, cappucino, etc... only thing on offer was decaf instant coffee. You may also want to ask for a rear facing room if possible. Ours faced the main road out front and emergency vehicles with sirens went by constantly in the night, making for a less than optimal sleep. If we were going to be here more than the 2 nights I would have asked for a room change and complained about the WiFi, but as it was we just dealt with it before moving on.","June 17, 2019","15    Hotel Canada Milano

First, double check the location...it’s a longer walk than the hotel let’s on. About 15-20 minutes to get to the center of town. The room itself was relatively nice/clean, but the bed was not very comfortable and the room was VERY noisy. You could hear EVERYTHING happening on the floors above and below you.

We were thrilled that they gave us a room straight away (which we requested in advance knowing we would have just flown for 25 hours) and it was only 7:30am. We were also given a map of the city and our receptionist circled the key ‘must-see’ areas of Milan which proved to be so helpful!Our room on the first floor was on the smaller side but it was just perfect. The bed was big and comfortable, the ensuite was more than adequate and the TV had international channels. It didn’t bother us that the room was small because we were hardly there - there is so much to see and do in Milan that you need all the time you can have.The location is fine. The hotel is situated about a 10 minute walk from the Duomo and we quite enjoyed the walk (although not as much after a long day of touring). However, having said that, it is in close proximity to two metro stations and the tram so if you were really tired it was easy to get back. The hotel is in close proximity to restaurants and shops. The included breakfast was great. It had a selection of breads, spreads, hot food and fruit along with barista coffee. There were plenty of tables so whenever we chose to come down and eat, we could sit down straight away.The reception staff were terrific. It didn’t matter which one you spoke to, they were all so helpful with any query we had - how to get around, places to eat and where to shop.

750,"I came to Milan on business for two nights and, as planned, stayed another four nights on vacation using Milan as a base to go out of town on several of my free days. I chose this hotel out of two recommended by my hosts for its closeness to my place of work. Overall I was satisfied with the choice, though there were a few things I personally missed. For instance I'd have preferred a reception area that was more appealing as a place to sit, rest, wait for people and taxis, etc. At least there was such an area with several comfortable seats, chairs and tables, and a computer available to guests with the possibility of printing things out. I appreciated the provisions that were available gratis in the reception area at many times of day: a jug of orange juice, bowl of olives, and various small bites: ideal as a snack when coming home in the evening. I also appreciated the daily news sheets offering the days' news from different countries in the relevant languages. Breakfast was buffet style and served till 10.30 a.m. It had a good range of breakfast foods and drinks and treats. The staff at reception were courteous and helpful, a pleasure to deal with. Though I disagree with one who said that the Duomo is ""a few minutes"" walk from the hotel. It's not that close on my interpretation of ""few"" unless you walk in giant strides. But it is in walking distance. On arrival in the evening I had a problem figuring out the lighting system in my room. It involved using the key card to my room and pressing buttons in various orders. At the time there was only one person on staff who could help, and she was needed in reception. With her help I managed to access enough light for my purposes that night but never fully figured out the system. I recommend the hotel put a card in the room explaining how the system works, not that that would help someone searching for light on their first night. I would also have liked some discussion of the air-conditioning system on such a card. It took a while to realize that I could not adjust it myself, but it was controlled by reception: on or off, basically. I may be particularly obtuse about these things but I doubt that I'm alone in preferring to be given such information without having to figure it out. My room was spacious and quiet (as requested, high up) but, I felt, lacking in character: it had all I needed (including a safe and small fridge) but lacked any kind of personal touch. The bathroom was great and I was grateful for the shower caps. Though the street on which the hotel is located is pretty faceless, there are plenty of shops very nearby including groceries, and places to eat. In sum: the staff at reception were great, the room was fine, the location worked for me.","June 28, 2018","15    Hotel Canada Milano

752,"We stayed at the Canada Hotel for two nights before heading back to Toronto, Canada. I had read a lot of the reviews before booking our stay so I knew what to anticipate when we arrived. The hotel is clean and so conveniently located. It's close to restaurants, shopping and of course the Duomo Cathedral, a must see on any visit to Milano. We were checked in right away and was offered drinks and snacks which as great since we had been driving in a car for almost 3.5 hours. Our room was clean and very efficient. The bathroom was nice, but I do need to mention the shower stall is quite compact. Don't drop the soap...The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was a nice start to the day.

Room was a decent size although they did say they upgraded us to a suite (no addition charge. nice) but it was still smaller than a normal hotel room in the USA so makes me wonder how big the normal size rooms are. Room and common areas appeared to be very clean. We left early so not able to enjoy the breakfast although they did make use a bag to go, mostly packaged snacks which we mostly tossed so would probably pass on that. We were able to walk to the Duomo in about 10 minutes as well as several restaurants so a decent downtown location. Although is was a little difficult to find even with the GPS.

The room was cozy and comfortable - with a unique design that made it special (and memorable). It also had air conditioning, which was helpful as it was quite warm in Milan when we were there a couple weeks ago.

760,"We stayed at the RossoSegnale B&B for a week and used it as a base for exploring certain parts of northern Italy. The B&B's location just a few minutes walk from the Loreto subway station made it easy for us to go to and from Milano Centrale - the main train station - which is only one stop away from Loreto on the green subway line. We used our rail passes to travel from Milan to places like Torino, Verona and Genova - all in about one hour each way - using the high speed train service from Milan. High speed trains do require seat reservations, so in order to avoid standing in line when you need to be able to depart, we strongly advise committing to a schedule and making seat reservations on the Frecciarossa before leaving home. With the rail pass, the reserved seat supplement was no more than about 10 euros each way even for a distant destination like Verona. We loved not having to change hotels or to carry our luggage around just in order to do a full day of sightseeing in other cities. We also used a regular train to visit Bergamo which can be reached from Milan in under an hour. The B&B's welcoming proprietors, Alberto and Raoul, have done an extraordinary job of restoring their building. In addition to the beautiful decor, large bathroom, small writing room and lovely balcony overlook the back garden, our room - called ""Giallonovecento"" - was accessible by elevator which makes it possible for those who experience difficulty climbing stairs to enjoy a comfortable stay. The breakfast each morning in the charming downstairs breakfast nook was excellent, and in warm weather guests can enjoy both the beautiful garden and the roof terrace. We also liked the fact that there are a number of decent places to eat nearby. When we wanted a quick, inexpensive lunch we simply walked to the bakery located on Via Nicola Porpora about a block and a half away. They will heat a slice of their pizza for you, and also have drinks and some good pastries. There are stools for sitting, so patrons on the go can eat right there. For dinner, we enjoyed the Osteria Nuovo Convento recommended by our B&B hosts and located only a block and a half away on Via Giovanni Ricordi. For a comfortable, well appointed, quiet, welcoming place to stay or to use as a base for extensive local and regional sightseeing we can not too highly recommend RossoSegnale.","May 30, 2019","16    RossoSegnale B&B

762,"I am writing today a new review, because it has been about 10-12 times, that I stayed there in the last 6 years. I am regularly for work in Milan and the Rossosegnale has got for me my second home. I love it there after all these years still for everything: It’s style in the rooms, the breakfast room, the whole house and garden (Pippo!), the silence in the middle of Milan, the comfortable beds, the friendliness of the hosts Raoul and Alberto, the connected small art gallery, which has been several times for me a place of big “aaaahhhhs”, (because from time to time I bought there some pictures) - and finally the terrific recommendations for restaurants in the evening. Ena, the helping hand in the house is always smiling and knows always in the right second (!!) when I like to have my second coffee at breakfast, which makes me smile each morning as I leave the house for work or to travel back home. I would have had enough possibilities to change the place, but I didn’t. I mean: Travelling with the sensation of coming home..., it couldn’t be better. I made already yesterday my reservation for the next trip in September to Milan. Ah - and years ago I rented their loft close to the Navigli. Guess what?

The room was clean, quiet and comfortable, the bathroom quite spacious for Europe :-) and the building itself was a treat to explore. Every day we found a new treasure, a new piece of art in the room, in the hallways, in the kitchen. Modern, sleek, but with a very homey feel. We miss the morning cappuccinos and the beautiful music that played in the dining area. Some have noted that the B&B is a bit away from the city center. Of course it is not next to the Duomo, but it is located in a safe, quiet residential neighborhood. If you walk the five to seven minutes to the Loreto Metro Station, you can be practically anywhere you want in Milano in no time at all. And at RossoSegnale you have Raoul and Alberto to advise you on the best of their magnificent city.My husband and I highly recommend you end your search and book your stay here if you are lucky, like us.

785,"A review of this B&B has to start with the hosts Raoul & Alberto. They helped make our stay enjoyable in every way. Their recommendation on dining spots led to several memorable meals, especially Bracelleria where we went for my wife's birthday. The various forms of art around the house was very unique and we went home with a gorgeous necklace that was on display in our bedroom. Overall one of the best B&B experiences we have had in our travels.","September 11, 2017","16    RossoSegnale B&B

There is also an area exhibiting artworks from artists of diverse styles from around the world. The breakfasts are delicious, served in the pretty garden in warm weather. The location is so convenient for the metro, to take you anywhere you wish to explore in Milano. We had a small terrace to relax on after a busy day sightseeing ,before heading out for dinner. Alberto is always ready with tips for dining and will also book anything for you if you wish. A little gem ,hidden in a busy beautiful city!

791,"Raoul and Alberto have set the standards so high! That's why now it would be really hard for us to choose the accomodation elsewhere - after our recent stay at this wonderful BnB no hotel or appartment in the entire history of our travels (which is quite extensive!) can compare to Rossosegnale. This place is so unique, and we loved every tiny corner, every single interior design item and every second of our stay! The hosts are so welcoming, outgoing and friendly that they really made us feel at home. It's so precious when people not only love what they are doing but also share the best that they have with others! The room, the breakfast, the house itself, the works of art that surround you everywhere, the overall atmosphere and the location - everything was so perfect that I couldn't find a negative aspect even if I was presistently trying to!Well, I believe that no words can do favour to this place, but if I could describe it in one phrase, I'd say: usually we prefer sightseeing and being outside, but here we wanted to stay as long as possible inside:) And we are already thinking about coming back in winter!

It is well located very close to the Loreto metro station (where the red and green lines connect) so it is convenient for trips to the center and other areas of the city--it is true that the Milan metro is extremely easy to use. Our bedroom was certainly large enough with excellent bathroom facilities and a balcony overlooking a lovely garden area where breakfast can be served in good weather (but alas for us Milan was cool and rainy during our stay). The breakfasts were excellent with a variety of choices each day.The hosts, Raoul and Alberto, are extraordinary in their hospitality and in their willingness to make recommendations as to restaurants and attractions.

They can advise you on city tours which only Milanese can know! B&B is located in city center, 5 min from Loreto metro station and a walking distance to corso Buenos Aires - a well-known shopping prospect. The B&B is very cozy and unusual, as it has an operating Art gallery on the ground floor, and pieces of art everywhere. B&B has an inner garden, a small cozy kitchen and only 3 rooms, so you feel a real spirit of Milano and a personal approach living there. I felt like home or visiting a very close friends' house. My room had my favorite balcony overlooking a quiet inner garden, large modern bathroom, the bed was comfy, area is quiet so you can sleep well. In the garden you can have breakfast ,if weather allows. A lovely lady Ehna makes fresh breakfast in the morning and keeps the room clean. WIFI is fast. I stated all which is important for me when I travel and hope it will be helpful for travelers.

After asking us our interests and taste in food and restaurants, Alberto took the time to provide us with truly amazing tips on where to go for sight seeing and where to eat and made us necessary reservations. The hotel was an easy distance to all of Milan's greatest sights (by either walking or using the metro located very close by) and to fabulous restaurants we never would have found without Alberto and Raoul! It was also very peaceful and we very much enjoyed having a glass of wine and unwinding in the afternoon on the roof top terrace before dinner.

821,"I stayed here for four days in January. I chose this hotel largely because of price and location and, indeed, it was within 15-20 min utes walking distance of Central Station and closer again to one of th e city's major shopping areas, Corso Buenos Aires/Porto Venezia. There are many good and moderately priced restaurants in the surrounding area.The hotel looks quite plush and is warm and comfortable. My first impressions were somewhat unfavourable, however, as the hotel corridors smell quite unfresh (like the smell of a well-used vacuum cleaner bag) and the twin room I booked was smaller than I could ever have imagined, despite having read others' comments to this effect. Nevertheless, I soon found that, although small, the layout was well thought-out and the room did contain all we needed to make for a comfortable stay. After a day or two I stopped noticing the smell of the carpets.Breakfast was variable - always a good selection with lots of bread and pastries (including delicious chocolate and pear flan on one occasion) and also cooked food - scrambled egg, bacon, sausage, although staff seemed to have trouble keeping this warm.One of the hotel's best assets is undoubtedly the friendly and obliging reception staff, particularly Stefano who was always willing to advise us of places of interest to visit and who took the effort to find us an English-speaking cinema. Another member of reception staff, whose name I do not know, loaned me some hair straighteners which she advised I could hold on to until I was leaving.In conclusion, my stay at the BW Felice Casati was a positive one and, if I ever visit Milan again, I would most likely stay here.","March 22, 2019","17    Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati

We took the Malpensa Express from the airport for 13 euros per person to Cadorna FN station ( about 40 minutes), and then the metro to Porta Venezia station (6 stops). It was about a 5 minute walk from the nearest station exit. The hotel staff was very nice, spoke English and the check-in process was very quick. Our room was on the 4th floor with a vaulted ceiling. Room size is what I expected with two single beds. Everything in the room was clean and bathroom had a shower. Room was very quiet since it was block from any busy road and we never heard sounds from other rooms. The room had a mini fridge. The breakfast was included, and was much nicer than I expected with everything from croissants to mozzarella cheese. Hotel wifi speeds were always very fast with no issues. The TV had CNN in English. We did not use the workout room nor bar but the hotel had both.It is about a ten minute walk to Milano Centrale and very easy to get to.

It started with the reception staff being less than helpful.The moment we reached the room, it literally had enough room for two cabin bags and 1 and a half people on a queen bed. The walls needed maintenance and the whole hotel (apart from the reception) needs refurbishment. Some parts of the hotel were smelly and the lift was so small that even five kids would feel cramped inside. And yes, there was one gentleman from reception staff who did help us call for a taxi later but could not help us with another room despite it being our honeymoon.The only silver lining was the breakfast as the food was alright and the restaurant staff was polite and warm.

She also promised that our room will be ready not later than 02.00 PM. So, we left our bagagge hotel locked locker room, and we took off looking for lunch.Got back at the hotel just couple minutes after 01.00 PM when we tols that our room is ready.The check in was smooth. Our luggage was brought already to our room.The room as we expect, not so spacious but efficiently designed, moreover it is sufficient for us. The hotel -in our opinion- was run effectively and efficiently. It has all necessity room amenities, some of them are just need to be requested via frontdesk...but it was not a big deal.Locationwise, only within throwing stobe distance to a tram stop (No.1 and No.5) that can seamlessly bring you to Milano Centrale train/metro station. The nearest metro station is only 5 minutes walking distance.On second day -which is Sunday- we decided to back to the hotel early (around 05.00 PM, as we couldn't take the heatwave any longer that day). We found out that our room was not made up. We felt a bit dissapointed, before 10 minutes later the room service lady knocked our door to made our room. She was shocked finding us in the room, she apologized that she was very busy that day (and we were thinking that she was doing some overtime). We told her that she can be back the day after, when she thanked us while handing over sone fresh towels and new bathroom amenities.Great location.Polite staffProfessional staffBreakfast is available with only small charge cost!!! - cheaper than having breakfast at the sourounding cafe.Recommended and worth to try and stay at this hotel.","July 10, 2017","17    Best Western Plus Hotel Felice Casati

Was supposed to pay on arrival- was told reservation was cancelled and would not be charged... Had only made the reservation a few hours before the plane left and the hotel was close to empty so they definitely weren't losing the income of renting to another client from me almost being in a plane crash however despite being told I would not be charged, I was charged anyway. Have contacted Hotel Casati on 3 separate occasions and no one has ever bothered to respond. Finally requested to a Chargeback from my bank-they responded to that claiming the charges were valid. Clearly they do not care at all about their guest experience and their customer service is beyond lacking. They legally cannot charge me because Force Majeure which nullifies all contracts because I could not reasonably hold up my end of it- same as if they had an earthquake and the hotel was destroyed- they would not be liable for their end of providing accommodation in such an instance- because it is out of the realm of reason.

We were duly given our room keys and then advised that our bags had been taken to the room by the porter - a very nice surprise and saved us struggling with the bags.We reached the room and were blown away by the beauty and charm of the hotel. It didn't cost us much money to stay here. The hotel is very nicely styled, almost Parisien with the dramatic drapes and classic furniture.As we had an early flight we weren't able to have breakfast, but it certainly looked very tempting.

867,"The location was very convenient - a short walk to the city centre, Duomo, etc. Also down a nice quiet street, though, which was a plus. The building itself is quite cool and unique too, as it is architecturally old and detailed, but revamped inside.The included breakfast was a great touch, as it took out some of the guesswork for where I should eat and gave me more time to spend on my actual plans for the day. Not super diverse, but very tasty.The staff were always pleasant, and willing to answer questions and help you if you needed.I'm on the fence about the actual rooms - I loved how there was an individual lamp and power point/charger connector with every bed (bunk beds), and the room was light and spacious with big windows. However, I did not love that the rooms had their own bathrooms - yes, it was more convenient than walking further to a more communal one, but being the only female among five male strangers made me a little uncomfortable to use the bathroom, and the shower stalls were so small that you could only really use the whole bathroom when having a shower, which made it hard for 6 people.","May 2, 2019","18    Babila Hostel

Hilton Milan is in a great location, just minutes walking to Milano Centrale for train travel, Metro, or even the Hop-on Hop-off bus stop across the street from both. Travel was a breeze. (Note: We goofed on our arrival and chose the wrong exit from the train station, so we ended up rolling suitcases over cobblestone and going ""around"" the hotel. Make sure you go out the main entrance (you'll see a big apple sculpture), and then it's a simple two blocks on the flat sidewalk!)The room we choose had extra floor space, perfect for keeping our luggage out of the way.The executive lounges are always one of my favorite benefits, and Hilton Milan was no exception, with one small annoyance. There is a sign at the entrance about consuming food and beverages within the lounge, but in all the hotels I have visited (which are many), taking a soda back to my room has never been an issue. On our last night here, we were stopped from taking 2 cokes back to the room, and it wasn't done in a very friendly manner. Honestly, if we were taking plates of food, etc., I would expect to be stopped, but for two cans of coke?

I have to say they were spot on, from the moment we arrived at check-in, we were greeted by Daniela, who I have to say made our family feel totally welcome. We stayed in a family-sized room, very spacious, good AC (it was hot when we were there and we really appreciated that), we used the Executive lounge throughout our stay, relaxing prior to going out to dinner or just a quick coffee before heading out for the day. A good supply of snacks and drinks, a good-sized lounge that serves its purpose, no complaints. I also have to call out the concierge, Pio who was amazing and gave us some great places to check out for shopping, dinner, and sightseeing, that we could fit our 3 full days in Milan, I think we pretty much covered them all, he was super helpful. Overall we had a great stay, and for me, as this was a family break, we all really appreciated the efforts made by the staff to make us feel welcome and appreciated, even the little polaroid photo that the staff at breakfast took of us on our first-morning breakfast was just another WOW moment, small thing, but highly appreciated and a nice memento of our stay.

So I want to say this review is going to be more for those with executive status as this is what I am reviewing.So if you have diamond status, you automatically get upgraded to a room with a king bed or close to the executive lounge. The executive lounge is great because it has food or snacks almost all day long. After a long day, it was nice to come back to the lounge any time for soft drinks, water and snacks. Of course alcohol is at the happy hour! I loved it but my husband who travels to a lot of Hilton’s said it was not as amazing as he had elsewhere. The lounge was just packed for happy hour with almost no place to sit. People were there who purchased a room with executive benefits. But.... it was August when we came to Milan!! In the Executive lounge, there is an outdoor patio but since many people smoke in Italy... I did not like to be out there much.

907,"We stayed for one night at the Hilton Milan this July with our two teenagers. The hotel is perfectly located one block from the Milano Centrale train station, which makes transferring from the airport a breeze! Upon arrival the front desk staff were incredibly helpful and welcoming, with a special thanks reserved to Riccardo who was excellent. Our family suite with a connecting twin room was vast and spacious - the three bathrooms were certainly appreciated by our teen girls! The hospitality team delivered a bar cart laden with appetizers, sweets, prosecco and drinks to our room as they knew we were touring and missed happy hour in the executive lounge. What a treat! The buffet breakfast was truly impressive - my girls voted it the best breakfast in the entire month we were travelling in Europe. Kudos to hotel manager Nassos Papazoglou and his team for managing this hotel so well. We will definitely stay again the next time we are in Milan. Thank you for making our stay specail - grazie mille!!!","July 30, 2019","19    Hilton Milan

But snacks and drinks we plentiful. Servers were very attentive clearing tables and providing the needs of the pantrons. The room left a little to be desired especially for an Executive Room.

Location is just 200 Mtrs away from Milan central station. Currently I am staying in this hotel and moment I checked in it was pretty smooth . I was treated with smile by Gentleman name Johnny Giovanni. My check in was smooth and being the Hilton Honours Gold member I was upgraded to executive large room with executive lounge benefits. I was surprised to know that this guy is working in this hotel from last 39 years. Then we were helped by Faisal at Bell desk who really helped with our bag which was damaged during travelling and he always greeted us with smile .We are Asian vegetarian so the duty manager Ricardo and F&B manager really helped us in Breakfast and in executive lounge that we get vegetarian food specially prepared for us . Andre at executive lounge really look after us very well. Paola at concierge is a great guy and great help for us to plan all our trips .

Also, you need to be ready for shared bathroom. It is not convenient. And, most of the problems was very squeaky floor and echo. This is old Italian building and every move is seems to be very loud. If you are sensitive in this way, think twice. For young people, probably ok. ( This is only my opinion and referred to those who is sensitive for noises during sleep time.

940,To start we really liked this place. It appears to be an older apartment with just two bedrooms. There were just a few issues that kept me from giving 5 stars Two of the issues aren’t really under anyone’s control...1. The BB is in an apartment and office square. So late at night and in the morning it’s loud...really loud...especially if you have a window open. I think the noise is from garbage pickup. I can sleep in noise so it didn’t bother me as much but it’s legitimately loud. I highly doubt a small child could sleep with that level of ambient noise. Again it’s not really something the B.B. can control 2. On booking.com the advertisement said free parking no reservation needed. While this is technically true they failed to mention that this is in reality street parking. Again not an issue except this is Milan and parking is a nightmare - especially for out of town guests who aren’t used to it. That said we parked on the sidewalk. Yes on the sidewalk. I will try to attach a photo to this review to show. So you not only have to identify an open spot but then navigate a rental car in some tight places. If you happened to rent a full size car parking would have been impossible and you would have to find a pay garage. My only issue here is that when someone says free parking you tend to think they have their own parking spots or lot for guest use. 3. Another noise observation. Since this is an older apartment it’s very creaky and noisy. So if the people using the other bedroom come home late there is no way to avoid hearing every step and door closing. 4. My final issue isn’t so much an issue as an observation. The proprietor is not located on site. Therefore when you arrive you may have to call them to come meet you. It was only a pain for us because we had to walk up to the second floor. Figure out no one was there and sort of double park while we called them. Again since parking and traffic is tough this wasn’t the easiest maneuver. All in all it was very nice. Good cold breakfast that is set out the night before. Good location and helpful proprietor ,"May 13, 2018","20    Libeccio Bed & Breakfast Milano

The b&b is situated in just 25 minutes walk to Duomo and 5 minutes walk to Buenos Aires av. - one of the main shopping streets of Milan, and it's like 1,5 km from the Central Station which is really comfortable.You will find supermarket, different bars and cafes nearby, but that ones you'll need only for lunch o dinner, 'cause Maria provides a complete Italian breakfast.You won't regret!","October 18, 2016","20    Libeccio Bed & Breakfast Milano

Excellent value for the money. 2. Everything inside is very nice and really good quality: beds, furniture, bathroom and so on. 3. The place is cozy and you can feel like at home (Generally speaking, that was the first time in our experience when photos = the real view of the room). 4. Well located in walking distance to all the sights of the city. 5.

Maria was lovely, gave us great directions on how to get there, greeted us on arrival even though our flight was delayed several hours so we were late!. She prepared a simple breakfast everyday, coffee, juice, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins.

Tone location is perfect, just a short walk from Porta Venezia metro station and one of the best shopping streets in Milano, Corsa Buenos Ayres. There are a lot of authentic restaurants just outside the door, having authentic nor den Italian food and menyes not translated to English which is the good sign for food lovers. At tusdays there is a local food market which was a nice surprise for us, who love authentic food. Our host Maria has been perfect in each perspective possible; she is very friendly and helpful. She keeps the place unbelievably clean, have never stayed at an apartment so clean and fresh as Libeccio, bravo Maria! :) Every afternoon she sets the table for breakfast and every morning cleans the kitchen after breakfast. We got fresh pressed orange juice every morning, can you believe it? Maria helped us with the taxi and all the questions we had, about local food, transport, shops, etc.We had the perfect stay at Libeccio and will sertanly recommend this accommodation to everyone who wants to have a pleasant holiday in Milano.","March 19, 2016","20    Libeccio Bed & Breakfast Milano

956,"We recently stayed 3 nights in Libeccio B&B Milan, and found our stay very pleasant. Matteo was great in responding to our queries in a very timely manner and was very good to deal with. We arrived via train, and the B&B was only 7 euro taxi away from the central station. The check in was efficient. Our room (a double) was spacious and homey. The apartment was very stylishly decorated. The first night was just the two of us, so the apartment certainly felt very big! Fridge was filled with fruits, yogurt and juice. Coffee machine was good. Breakfast was plentiful. One thing about this B&B was its location in a nice suburb. While it's about 6-8 minutes walk to the closest tram/subway stop, the surroundings were very pleasant and you got a taste of what life was like as a local. We walked to Duomo on the first day (40 minutes) - I probably wouldn't recommend it, as it's so much easier to just take the tram that is 8 minutes walk away. There are quite a few good restaurants and shops within walking distance and the neighbourhood feels safe. The apartment is inside a locked gate and it felt really safe. One thing to note is that if you call a taxi to the central station (or anywhere), you might want to get there early (say 5-10 minutes early before your taxi is supposed to arrive). We got to the gate 1 minute before our scheduled time, the taxi was already there, and the metre was 10 euro...so even though it was a short drive, our taxi cost more than double of what it should be. Alternatively you could take the bus 60, which has a stop just outside the apartment gate.","September 21, 2014","20    Libeccio Bed & Breakfast Milano

Unfortunately the way my trip was planned I was unable to pick them up myself, so the person I was corresponding with said that she would be able to send them to my home address, they arrived this morning, so thanks to them I managed to save having to buy a new pair of glasses or flying back to Milan just to pick them up!

Permanent offer of free food (yoghurts, pasta, sauces, fruits, cookies, tea, coffee) during whole stay in the kitchen, co you haven´t go to overpriced restaurants. Two nice terraces. Excellent bar (I definitely fall in love with the Long Island Ice Tea here). Perfect cleaning service in room.

They provided a welcome drink and towel, which I wasn’t expecting. The room was clean, sheets were crisp, and the bathroom was sparkling. Most importantly, I always felt safe. The hostel lobby is a popular place for locals to drink and eat, so it can be noisy at times. One night, they had an amazing swing band perform in the basement! Even with all this excitement, I never noticed the noise once I was in my room. I can’t speak to the food due to eating at restaurants, but it smelled and looked great every night. In the morning, I always had the free cappuccino or espresso, and they were delicious. Finally, the location was very central. I waked everywhere, but it’s also close to the metro if you choose. Overall a wonderful time and experience! ","January 26, 2019","21    Ostello Bello

Enjoy drinks in their main area with guests and locals in the evening - don't worry, you don't have to mingle because it's not about organised fun. We had one of the 2 bed bedrooms on the top floor - as expected small but you don't need more. Plenty of space to sit indoors and out on different floors, kitchen with some basics (milk, yoghurt, fruit etc.) to get you going and equipment to cook for yourself, friends/family. Good daily recommendations on where to go/what to see in the city and a lively schedule of their own events in the lounge/basement. We arrived too late for their 3pm walking tour at 3pm - good to get your bearings..if you're into that! I would recommend staying at the hostel.","November 14, 2018","21    Ostello Bello

1003,"On Friday, June 22nd, I went to Ostello Bello with a group of Brazilian friends to watch the game Brazil vs Costa Rica. We've chosen the place because of its friendly and youthful atmosphere, but this time we didn't get the service we expected.The game was early, 14h, and there were mostly Brazilians and tourists there, plus a couple of Italians. At the beginning, it was all quite cheerful, but then some situations put us off quite a bit.First, they asked to take a picture of us, but without the only guy that was with us. They wanted a photo with ""Brazilian girls"" only. Then, they kept asking us to dance funk, although all of us were there just watching the game and cheering for our country. It got to the point where they muted the game and put funk music on.Some may say that it was a joke, or they just wanted to keep the mood light, but it didn't feel like that to any of us. It was annoying and uncomfortable. And it shows that Ostello Bello's staff is not able to see their customers beyond commonplaces and stereotypes.","June 26, 2018","21    Ostello Bello

I didn't need this, but it's always nice to know. I enjoyed the free arrival drink. The food and breakfast aren't worth rushing in for if you're arriving late (as I was), but if you're staying for more of a hostel experience it's lovely to eat and chat and meet folk. I didn't get up to the rooftop as it was raining, but it's there, and there's a lift, that works perfectly, although it's small, old and slow, which is to be expected in an old building in the centre of town.

Bathroom was also very nice. However, the staff at the front desk were not nice. The bell boys and the bartender were polite. Front desk staff (multiple) were very rude and not helpful. Although the hotel was nice, I would not return to this hotel. The front desk person who I had initial contact with set the tone for me and the rudeness continued with other front desk agents and I even witnessed it with other guests. Management needs to change the front desk employees.","July 27, 2019","22    Hotel Manin

1030,"I was having some serious buyers remorse after booking Hotel Manin, I opted to upgrade for a room with a Balcony, I stayed three nights and it was $2,200 USD total the room overlooked the gorgeous Giardini Pubblici Indro Montanelli (park, a must to explore). Upon arriving, I was delighted! The bed was so comfortable and the view of the park was very peaceful. I felt very safe and I definitely appreciated the attention to detail (most notably, the cleanliness). I loved wearing the really plush robe while laying on the memory foam bed and ordering room service, it was a dream! They even provide a complimentary Italian cake. The wall paper was trendy and the purpose lighting was luxury! I suggest getting the breakfast, have a latte and eat a croissant filled with cream. On my last day there was a guy making canoli it was amazing. I can not wait to come back but next time I will probably opt for the standard room.

Breakfast was included and I enjoyed the food but unfortunately on going down to breakfast at the weekend the restaurant was full and so we decided to eat outside. There were no tables so we had to set up ourselves. This wouldn't have been a problem had all the waiting staff not been involved in moving tables for an evening event. Their priorities were wrong. On one evening we were invited to a cocktail party. There was a small charge but we didn't know what was included. It seemed that none of the staff did as we were told to ask 3 different members of staff. In the end we gave up and went out elsewhere.

1049,"I would like to mention that I am not a person who usually posts bad reviews, instead, I usually try to post nice reviews because I really believe that great service deserves great feedback and if I have a bad time somewhere it just can be an accident. This, however, is a warning to travelers. I think it’s best if you stay away from this hotel. I myself will never ever come back here.After three terrible days staying at this hotel, they even stole our backpack inside the hotel, and then threatened us not to call the police. The receptionists are very rude, we NEVER ONCE got a simple apology, instead, they lied to our face. Camping in a tent in the middle of the woods is safer than this place! We had to call the police so prove them that they stole our backpack!!I booked Hotel Manin for my family (5 people) who came to Milan to visit me from 18.03.2018 to 22.03.2018, a Double Room and a Junior Suite for 3 kids.On March 18th, we arrived at the hotel at 12:00, when we checked in the hotel receptionist told us our room numbers and explained that the rooms are very large rooms viewing to the park beside the hotel one in the 6th floor and the other one in the 3rd floor. Then he asked us to pay all the cost (1587,52 euro) in advance without showing us the rooms. Since it was strange for me, I politely asked if it was possible to pay at check out, which he refused, telling us that in our reservation conditions it was indicated that we must pay at check-in. I trusted him and paid all in advance. Then he told us the rooms will be ready for check-in in 2 hours. He said to leave them our luggage and come back in 2 hours, and they will bring our luggage to the room too. So we decided to have lunch and come back to the hotel at 14:00.When we came back, they gave us the keys to the rooms, however, we found out that the room numbers are changed. Anyway, we went to the rooms to check them, and we found out that their junior suite is a really tiny suit, with 2 single beds and a sofabed. We were quite surprised to see the smallest standard room for 3 people. We checked the windows and they had no view of the park and also our luggage was not in any of the rooms, so we thought maybe they gave us the wrong rooms. Then we decided to go back to the reception and ask why the rooms were changed and why our luggage was not in the room. When we talked to the receptionists (a man and a woman) both denied having said that the rooms are large with a view of the park! They were very rude to us and kept pretending that they never changed the rooms, they said that they never talked about the room size or the view of the windows. They claimed that we are confused and tired and that we are making a mistake. Finally while discussing to her I saw a paper on the reception desk, on which I could read my name with our previous room numbers. The funny thing is that the room numbers on the paper were exactly the numbers she told us in the beginning. So I showed her the paper and it was proven she was lying! At this point, both receptionists tried to take the paper from me telling me that I because of privacy rules I shouldn’t have read that paper, while just 2 hours ago they themselves gave that paper to me to find my name on it…!I told the receptionists, that if there is any problem with our previous room they could tell us honestly and we would accept, but lying to us is not a professional manner!But the lady refused to even say sorry!!!I insisted to talk to the Hotel Manager, but the reception refused to let me talk to anyone.They refused to cancel our reservation and refund us, so we asked them if they could at least add another bed instead of the sofa bed, but they said they can not!So since we had already paid 1587 euro, we decided to stay in the hotel although we were not satisfied.The second night during our stay, my daughter said that late at night she heard a lot of noise from another room and couldn’t sleep, then suddenly someone knocked on their room’s door, as soon as my daughter opened the door the receptionist started to yell at her, to stop making noise, then he entered the room, and only when he saw that the noise is coming from upstairs and not from our room he just excused and left the room!The last day, while doing check-out around noon, someone stole our backpack inside the lobby. We were so much sad and shocked, we asked the hotel to call police but, they were acting very shady, they told us that the police is NOT coming, and they tried to threaten us, telling us if the police comes they will block our passports and we would not be able to leave Italy anymore. But this time we didn’t trust them and called the police when the police came, hotel manager first didn’t allow them to check the Hotel’s security cameras. After the police and we insisted finally they let the police see the tape. The police said they could see the face of the thief in the tape, and that they will search for him. But since we had a flight at 16:00, we had to go to the airport.We will come back next week to Italy and we will make sure to go to police station and make an official report.","March 22, 2018","22    Hotel Manin

The room had a nice flat screen TV and a large bed, however the bathroom was almost as large as the living/sleeping area (again, very good per European standards)....anyway, the outdoor eating area is very welcoming and inviting.

Then when I moved the phone to plug in my iPad, there was bread crumbs or sandy substances on the night stand. I immediately got a wet towel and clean all surface inside the room. Most disappointing aspect was the ""uncaring/cold attitude"" towards guests from almost all the staffs, front desk, restaurant, and bar. Could it be a racial issues here?

Last month, we returned to find the property beautifully remodeled and a greatly upgraded restaurant. The staff members were very helpful, the room was clean and comfortable, and the food was very good, both at breakfast and the two dinners we enjoyed in the restaurant. It will definitely remain ""our"" place in Milano!","June 16, 2017","22    Hotel Manin

1066,"I'd like to make clear that my two-stars is based on the terrible rudeness both my wife and I experienced from the receptionist. In honesty this review would be one star if the manager had not been very professional and apologised for the behaviour of his staff member.It all started when my wife phoned the receptionist, Lucretia, as there was only a standard four-seater taxi waiting for five people at the airport who had a large number of suitcases with them. Yet instead of apologising for this mistake, she told my wife this was her fault for not requesting a minivan! This was total nonsense as in my email, which the hotel confirmed, the very first sentence stated, ""I would like to confirm a minivan for 5 people with room for up to 10 suitcases"".When I bought this up later with the receptionist, she said well it didn't matter because the minivan driver had to wait for my wife and our guests anyway while they were eating! They were only eating because they were told it would be an hour for the minivan to arrive and decided to do that while they were waiting! Instead of apologising for what was clearly her or somebody else at the hotels's mistake, she argued and argued in a very aggressive manner. It is the worst attitude I have ever experienced from somebody working in customer service. She lied, could not accept responsibility and was rude and aggressive, only seeking to escalate the situation rather than resolve it. It was very shocking. The other staff were all friendly and helpful, the room was clean and nice with a good terrace, the hotel is very well-located and this would probably be a 4-star review if it wasn't for the terrible behaviour of one employee. Whether she'd had a bad day or not it was totally unacceptable.","May 10, 2017","22    Hotel Manin

I asked a man at the reception desk and they cleaned it. However there were no apologises. The only plus is that the hotel is really near the center of the city and all the shopping streets.

1111,"An entrance on a narrow side street in the historical quarter of Milan leads to an exceptionally stylish, modern, tranquil and charming hotel. Friendly and helpful staff accompany guests to their rooms which are sparkling with white tiled floors, large comfy beds dressed in spotless linen and a spacious very well quipped bathroom. Breakfast is buffet style but provides everything one would want, from fresh fruit to tempting pastries, cold cuts to eggs and meats, juices and yogurts to fresh coffee. The bar is open in the evenings serving a free first drink, a pleasant guest-friendly gesture which can be enjoyed in the garden area. Attractive modern art, sculptures and wall reliefs adorn the public areas. The location is perfect for sightseeing in Milan being barely 10 minutes’ walk from the Duomo. This hotel doesn't have the glitz of some of the upmarket city hotels - or their soullessness and superficiality. Instead this hotel has a distinctive individual style, with the wellbeing of guests at the forefront. Through thoughtful design of space it provides a welcome respite within the centre of a busy bustling metropolis. It deserves to be recognised as one of the best hotels in Milan.","October 4, 2019","24    Hotel Milano Castello

1113,"There is just something creepy about this hotel. Yes, it may be new or renovated but only part of the facility seems to have been renovated. Other parts look abandoned with opened, dark windows and construction materials visible in other windows. Upon arrival we were told our room was not ready. When we decided to wait, there was then a room ready immediately which I could not understand. There didn't seem to be any guests when we arrived - the place looked like a ghost town. At the evening cocktail hour (1 free drink and snacks) we saw around 10 guests. Our room was clean and appeared new and sparsely decorated. (No kettle or coffee was disappointing). The hair dryer attached to the wall required me to constantly hold a button down to keep it running, which frustrated me enough to dig my own dryer out of the bottom of my suitcase already packed for travel home. We could not get the air conditioner to work. The staff did schedule me a taxi for an early pick up which arrived on time. The location of this hotel is indeed is good, withing walking distance to Duomo and a walk-able hike to Cordona station (thus the taxi). However, we couldn't shake the uneasy feeling we both had when we left this ""Bates Motel.""","September 27, 2019","24    Hotel Milano Castello

1118,"I recently stayed for one night on the last night of a business trip. The hotel is conveniently located near many tourist attractions and is about 10-15min walk to the Duomo, San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore and the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. Nearby are many shops and restaurants/cafes. I had a very pleasant stay and wished that I could have stayed another night. The staff are very pleasant especially Valentina at the front desk. I arrived early and luckily a room was available and she was able to check me in. They stored my luggage after I checked out to allow me to do some last minute sightseeing before leaving for the airport. The hotel seemed new or recently renovated with a modern yet spartan decor. My room had a very comfortable double bed and it was quiet. It was on the smallish side but not surprising for a hotel at this price point. Both room and bathroom were very clean. The photos for the hotel are pretty accurate. Lobby, dining area and terrace were very pleasant. The breakfast was included in my rate and it was fine—nothing memorable but it did have cereal options as well as pre-made eggs, ham and bacon. I would definitely stay here again but would like it more if the decor was less austere. Art and colorful textiles/bed covers in the rooms would make a big difference. The room would then skew more chic and less budget looking. Lastly boxes of tissues in the room would be a plus","July 27, 2019","24    Hotel Milano Castello

The rooms and bathroom were large, well designed and decorated in with modern marble accents. The breakfast was also very good as there does not seem to be local places to eat a morning meal. The design of the hotel was very tasteful with special emphasis on ecological practices. One artist was featured throughout the first floor. The hotel is very conveniently located 10 minutes front the Duomo, the Sforza Castle and the Berea artist/shopping district, Each is important to visit.

1124,"This is a lovely, tranquil hotel in the heart of Milan, walking distance from everything. The little outdoor cafe area is lovely, and the breakfast is nice, as well. Staff is nice, too. The only issue--when I got there the woman told me it looked like I had not paid the extra for breakfast for the two nights I was there. I expressed surprise since in Italy breakfast usually comes included in the price. ..at least that was the case when I lived in Italy ten years ago. The lovely receptionist said not to worry, that I would not be charged--tehy would ""offer it to me"" free. I asked several times to make sure it was the case and that I had not misunderstood her Italian. Then when I went to checl out after two nights I was given two bills-once for the room and a second for eight euros. I assumed this was tax of some sort and it was not until later when I was already on the train that I realized I had been charged for the breakfast! It was a different receptionist and perhaps there was a misunderstanding, but it was irksome. Otherwise, all was fine. The room was super clean, albeit a little spartan (art on the walls would be nice). The bathroom was great--large by Italian hotel standards, and my room had cross ventilation (a window in the bathroom and one overlooking the courtyard), which was nice as the air conditioner had not yet been turned on for the season and it was hot in the room in the daytime. All in all, I would definitely stay here again, but would make sure to be more careful in checking my bill before I leave.","May 15, 2019","24    Hotel Milano Castello

The Brera area is also just 5 minutes walk away with a lovely selection of restaurants. We went to the Ticinese canal area for dinner on the Saturday which was really busy, a fantastic atmosphere. We walked there which took about 30mins but caught the metro back which took about 15/20mins. We felt perfectly safe walking around Milan during the day and night and sat on the steps at il Duomo until gone midnight on Sunday night listening to the music coming from one of the surrounding restaurants, it was lovely. The hotel itself is great, nice and new and very clean. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well every night as the room was well soundproofed. There is a wall mounted hair dryer in the bathroom. It's one of those ones that you have to keep your finger on the button to make it work but its a 1600 watt so dries quite quickly so that you don't end up with a flat fingertip!!There aren't tea/coffee making facilities in the room but there are so many lovely coffee shops on the doorstep that you really don't need it. Breakfast was much better than we expected, a small selection of hot food (scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages) but a wide selection of fruit, yogurts, hams, cheeses, cakes and pastries, teas and coffee. It was nice to have the outdoor garden/patio area to sit in to eat breakfast and enjoy the complimentary drink in the evening. Even thought the hotel is very central it's lovely and quiet.As many other people have mentioned, the staff are very friendly and helpful and kindly printed our flight boarding passes for us.

The reviews on Tripadvisor were positive but it was even better than we expected.It is located in a small street and has a specific atmosphere due to its location in a kind of an old area with an, I think, small church in between the reception and the restaurant/bar and room area.Check-in was friendly and swift and the room was spacious, modern and with all comfort one requires. Clean with good beds and a nice and large enough bathroom and shower.Also the hotel has a nice garden where one can have a drink or breakfast. There is no evening meal service but with the possibilities around one will easily find something for lunch/dinner.For the breakfast one pays EUR 7,50/person and it has more than enough choice of nice and fresh products. Very much worth its value.When we went for a drink downstairs we received the drinks as a treat from the hotel, very nice gesture. Also the other times we ordered a quick drink we got it offered for free, excellent service and customer friendliness.Overall the service was very nice, we really enjoyed our stay here and whenever visting Milan again this will be our hotel of choice!!Highly recommended!!","July 29, 2018","24    Hotel Milano Castello

We live near Milan and just were curious to have a look, to possibly recommend to friends and business partners. Staff was simply fantastic, giuded us around with a smile, and they offered to show us a room. This hotel is a true gem! Stylish reception and breakfast area, secluded garden away from noise and crowd, spacious room with impeccable furniture. We travel across Europe a lot, and we can say this is top standard for a 3-star hotel. Highly recommended!","July 8, 2018","24    Hotel Milano Castello

1151,"This was one of the best hotels i have visited in my life taking everything into consideration. From Malpensa airport, use the metro line 1 to cordusio stop from there it is 260m to the hotel. Di not take the bus to central station, that leaves you with another metro ride and 300m walking. I do not know why google maps doesn’t show this as easily the best way to get to the hotel. The hotel is clean! Marble floors, the fridge is stocked full with drinks and it is free. Rooms are big bathroom as well. Location is great, shops around it, as well as places to eat, duomo is also very close. They give two pillows per person on the bed, why cant everyone do this from the start. Staff was very friendly and you can leave your luggage on the last day when checking out, safer than most other hotels. Breakfast was amazing and you can even order cuppachino, breakfast buffet include various pastries, ham, salami, boiled eggs, cheeses, cereals, yogurt, 100% fruit juices in bottles and sweet stuff such as macaroons etc. so that is enough to get you going in the morning. I know it doesn’t sound different to most other good hotels but it just was, for us at least. ","January 13, 2018","24    Hotel Milano Castello

1154,"I'd actually give this 4.5 stars if possible.Stayed here for 4 nights in June 2017. Our apartment was Emmanuelle Vitto (it has the teal bed accent in the photos). This room overlooks the backside of the building, so no view to speak of. What I liked: location is superb, good bed and pillows, air conditioning actually gets cold, HUGE shower with rainfall and shower wand. Apartments were exceptionally clean. Plenty of electrical outlets and even a USB port that connects to the television. The kitchenette was a clever design; it was equipped with basic stemware, dishes and flatware for 2, small refrigerator/freezer, 2 burner cooktop, microwave, electric tea kettle and Nespresso coffee maker. I think there was only one skillet and one saucepan, otherwise no other cookware. Also no cutting board or cutlery to speak of other than the serrated steak knives. We arrived at approximately 11 am and were allowed to check in early, which was very nice. My understanding is that there is someone at the “desk” (it’s really more like a closet) every morning from 9-12, but check-in is by appointment. Access to the apartments is secured by a very heavy door that is accessed via key card, as is your apartment, so I felt very secure. The main door to the building is also locked after a certain time at night and must be accessed using your key card. Aparthotel staff was very helpful in securing transport to the airport for 100 Euro. Comparable to the price of a taxi, it was very convenient and prompt. Our one small hiccup occurred on the Sunday morning we were to check out. We decided to go for a walk and grab a pastry before our airport transport was to arrive at 8:30 (checkout is at 11). But when we returned at approximately 7:30, our key card didn’t work to access any of the doors. Luckily, I had the phone number to Aparthotel staff programmed in my phone so I called and they were quickly able to unlock both doors remotely. So cautionary tale – always take your phone with you and put the 24 hr. phone number in your phone! They do tell you this when you check in, so I'm just reinforcing it.","July 12, 2017","25    Aparthotel Duomo

1155,We stopped two nights whilst site-seeing in Milan. It makes a great base being just a minute from the Duomo and a few minutes from sites such as La Scala. It is a small place made up of half a dozen apartments with a part-time office. However what is great about the place is its style. Our room was done out all in white. Had a circular bed and TVs hidden behind mirrors. I particularly liked the hidden kitchenette - hob and fridge only. The guy on the reception was really friendly and kept in touch beforehand.

Some rooms have a spa bath as well.Two enormous plasma TV screens with more channels than one can be bothered to count are mounted on two walls.An extremely comfortable bed with high quality linen is mounted on a raised white (of course) platform. White floors give a clean and bright feel to a generous room space.State-of-the-art electrical controls operate everything from concealed lighting to the highly effective blinds.This is a superb property with a great individual feel about it.The office isn't manned 24/7 but receptionist/manager Luca could not be more charming, helpful and personable. He should be running the Ritz.Having stayed in a number of much more expensive and fashionable hotels in this city of overt fashion and self-conscious chic, I can unhesitatingly recommend the Aparthotel Duomo.I won't be staying anywhere else on my next visits to Milan.5 stars.","December 19, 2014","25    Aparthotel Duomo

However rooms were a good size, clean and without unnecessary frills. Service was polite and we were offered another room immediately when we reported a small fault with a light switch, which cause a light on a dimmer switch to come on unexpectedly. We declined, it was not serious enough for us to pack and unpack again. However, although it was a Sunday, it did surprise me no technician was available to look at this. Faults and failures don’t respect working hours. We booked through a web booking site, offering a deal. When we tried to book an additional night, we were quoted a much higher rate.

1184,"We booked a junior suite and got upgraded to executive junior suite upon check in. The room was huge and comfortable, walking distance from the Centrale station however the pin on the Google map was not accurate. We had to look out for 'UNA Hotel' sign and follow the sign instead. Breakfast was nice and simple with really good croissant. One thing to mention was the room service attitude. We asked for extra pillows on the first night, a guy delivered them to us with a dull face and even though I was polite and said 'Thank you', he never respond at all. On the third night, we requested for another set of towels because there was only one bath towel for the two of us after our room was cleaned in the afternoon. The same guy came and not say a word again. He could at least put on a smile? :) Overall a great hotel to stay in Milan!","July 17, 2019","26    UNAHOTELS Century Milano

Upon check in we discovered that the rooms are nothing like as advertised, extremely dirty and very unhygienic . As we spend more time, the conditions became more and more clear and we could not even sleep, and checked out at 6 am. The room walls all have stains of dirt, the floor is extremely dirty and old. The AC control until , all light switched , etc has a strange stink that we could not even touch. The condition in bathroom is worst, the bathroom is full of mold, the shower head is moldy and broken, the towels in the room all had stains to it and after several requests, the hotel replaced one. The conditions were unlivable for us and ended up cancelling our 2 nights stay for both rooms and stayed at nearby hotel.","June 3, 2019","26    UNAHOTELS Century Milano

Check in took a little too long, but we got in, the world cup was on - so that helped, staff were quite friendly, especially the chap behind the bar, who liked Juventus, talked very good english and football being a good topic , was a good help. Milan itself would recommend the aperol bar overlooking the Doumo, would not recommend the san siro stadium tour, as its complete rubbish, stadium is good, but the tour is very poor value for money.take extra care on the underground as we got stung for 34 euros for not getting a second ticket which cost 2 euros to get to the idays festival if you use the underground and travel outside the area, it was our own fault but there were about 20 guards waiting with their credit card machines for this, as they knew what was going to happen. Festival itself was great, but a long walk from the station when we got out, so when we got back to the hotel, made the most of the bed which was very comfy and the shower which was quite powerful to ease the muscles used...Breakfast was continental and very good.","October 6, 2018","26    UNAHOTELS Century Milano

A curt apology. We payed our bill and left. You can see how many poor reviews ive given on tripadvisor since 2006. Barely any.Im sure there's better hotels for the money spent here in Milan.

1213,"Don't get me wrong on the overall rating, it is a good modern business hotel. It has got a nice location, around 5-10mins walking from the Milan central station. The rooms are relatively large as compared to other hotels in the same price point. The breakfast is a good spread.Negatives-1.) They charge a Criminally prohibitive 10 EUR on every in-room dining. When most dishes are 12-15 Euros, its like charging 80% over the food. The hotel doesn't have a 24hr restaurant where you can go and have food and the main restaurant closes at 2.30PM. If you checkin by 3pm and want to have a soup/salad, God help you.2.) The bathroom just has the shampoo and a bar of soap. Along kept a note that if you need conditioner or dental kit then pls call reception. (not at this price point hotel).3.) The room doesnt have slippers or bath-robe, you have to call the reception again.4.) Its a business hotel and they dont have Iron-board in room OR even on request from room service. You have to use Laundry service for basic ironing.It is because of these reasons that I have rated it poor, considering its price point and the 10Euro charge is obscene.The hotel staff is courteous.

It had a wide range of items and good choice, including even fried rice and biscuits, along with traditional continental fare and cooked items like those you would find in an English breakfast. There was a good selection of hot and cold drinks too. The reception and particularly the housekeeping personnel were very friendly. They can provide a map of Milan if you need one. Overall, a very pleasant, luxurious and memorable stay. This hotel offers a wonderful base for exploring Milan.","December 26, 2017","26    UNAHOTELS Century Milano

1227,"We have from time to time done 1 day transit in Milan so looking for a hotel close to the train station/transport options to the airport is important to us. We didn't need anything fancy but we also wanted a nice modern hotel. We felt UNA Hotel Century delivered exactly what we needed.It's very close to the central train station and easy to find. The building is a bit tucked away next to other corporate/office/hotel buildings but the signage is relatively clear. & it felt safe. It's a business trip clientele oriented hotel but we saw families checking in as well.We had booked directly with the hotel website and Checkin was no fuss.Our room was on the 2nd floor (or 3rd floor for non-Europeans) and was huuge. It even had a treadmill in the room - which was a first for us -And we still had plenty of room to open 3 luggage bags. Very clean - simple modern furniture. We paid about €100/night with breakfast. Breakfast is from 7am and had good selection. if you had to leave before 7, just let the front desk know and they will prepare a mini breakfast bag for you.Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and look forward to return on our next Milan stopover trip!!","December 6, 2017","26    UNAHOTELS Century Milano

Only stayed for 1 night on business trip at walking distance from Porta Garibaldi/ shopping street/Eataly etc. Breakfast buffet had a wide variety and good quality. Very friendly staff. Only point for improvement: long waiting line to check out in the morning as you have to pay the city tax. Any option to have self check out? or give the option to pay this tax at time of check in. That would make the check out much more efficient.","December 6, 2017","26    UNAHOTELS Century Milano

It has a lot of games as well, including soccer table and snooker.The breakfast is ok according to the price you pay (also acoording with hostel and overall prices in the city).

They offered ham, cheese, fruit, juice, hot drinks, cookies and so on and it's included!

In the evening they played billard and met young people in the bar of the hostel. Of course, a hostel is not a hotel: You can´t expect superclean rooms and silence in the evening/night. It is a place for young people who dont´t want to spend too much money and who want to have fun. The stuff of the hostel is very friendly and patient.

1294,"My reason to give only 3 stars is because this is definitely not good for family people especially who have got small kids. Rooms are cleaned nicely. The minibar consists of just water bottles and 2 cans. The hotel won’t provide you with a kettle in the room when it’s important when you need to prepare milk including cleaning bottles. Secondly, the hotel don’t provide an iron in the room due to fire safety. You have to go downstairs if you want to use the hotel iron. You also have to go downstairs for coffee or tea or order through room service which then is expensive as tax is added. If your a morning tea or coffee lover you wont get any tea or coffee in your room because of no kettle, coffee or tea facilities provided in the rooms. Night staff Anthony was good and morning staff don’t know the lads name Asian speaks English he was really helpful and very friendly. I wont stay again especially as got got young kids.

1306,"Probably the worst experience I have had in my travels till date... Firstly had a small niggle with my bookings because of a death in the family we had to postpone our travel dates to Italy, and as our bookings were all done in advance we had to make changes all the other hotels during the trip agreed to make the changes for us without a charge barring this hotel (last hotel in the 12 day trip) which was fair as I had made the bookings knowing the terms. We checked and requested for the rates for extension for the last 2 nights. Night 1: Room #422 The air conditioning barely working we somehow made it through the night. Next day when we complained we were told ""our thermostat was set at 22° which was high and we are setting it to 18°"" after another 30 mins nothing happens we go and complain at the reception and are told that ""it's not a refrigerator that it will instantly cool it will take time"" however it was untolarable in the room and after dinner we again made a complaint and this time the same person at the reception says we can choose another room and are shown 2 rooms and we choose 1 where we felt the air conditioning was working fine. Night 2: Room #528 the room was considerably cooler and we had a goods night's rest. In the morning we realised that the bed was making funny squeaking sounds, As we had a long day we did not pay too much attention to it. Night 4: After we got back the bed felt broken and we made a complaint to the reception (different staff) and when we got back in the evening from a tiring and hot day trip to Lake Como our key cards did not work and we went to check at the reception they told us that our rooms have again been changed as that bed is broken, at 11 pm we had to again move our baggage to room number# 724 and we had an early check out. For all this trouble we were offered 2 complimentary drinks by the hotel. Does not deserve to call itself a 4* property. Having to pay as much as we did for this hotel and the behaviour and language was totally unprofessional and nothing like what we experienced anywhere in the whole of Italy.

We arrived relatively late in the afternoon and decided to dine in the restaurant -what a huge mistake. I have some dietary requirements and when I made a request to our non Italian waiter, I was told this is what they eat here! How rude! The result was that I could only eat 1/4 of the meat I had ordered and nothing else. The salad went back to the kitchen untouched, the greens inedible and dry/wilted. The bread we were presented with was dry and if I had t9 guess it could have been the left overs from breakfast, this was also not eaten. At no stage did the waiter ask if everything was okay and there was no question as to why most of my food went back at the end of our meal. We then refused desserts as I was not prepared to attempt after a terrible meal. Breakfast the next morning. Was slightly improved but not really up to par.

1317,"Stayed here for 3 nights end of April/May 2019. Took the train from airport and the exit from the Metro to the hotel is only a few hundred meters away. So you can use the metro to other destinations. The Metro is also so easy to use. Use your contactless credit/debit card if you do not want to queue up for the tickets. Check in was so quick, I think was less than 10 minutes. We arrived before check in time and was happy that the room was ready and we could check in. Access to the elevators required key cards, so safety is good. The room looks small, but cosy and comfortable. Large windows overlooking the street and some views. Bed is comfortable, soft pillows. Working desk with a really huge TV. The bathroom is properly equipped, good water pressure also. Breakfast was ok, not much choices, mostly bread, scrambled eggs, sausages and fruits, but the food is delicious !! The restaurant is shared with walk in customers, no issues there though.

Check in was so fast, received the keys to the room in less than 10 minutes.The room is small but cosy and comfortable. Comfortable beds and pillows, shower with good water pressure and amenities. Wifi was really fast and reliable. Breakfast was ok, not much choices, but good quality food.

Also tram and metro easily accessible.Carrefour supermarket is also 2 minsFor duamo you can walk about 25 mins ,nice walk or take tramCons:Front of staff lacks customer service, when we were checking in one person kept hopping from one computer to the other completely ignoring us and we were right in front of him at the reception.No greetings, hello or how are you just a robotic "" I need you passport and a credit card"" no explanation what the credit card is needed for. Just handed us 2 identical keys ,one for the lifts and one for the room which is the first hotel that has this system.Bathroom is very poor design, the shower cubical is way too small we are considered skinny and had to be careful as there was no space in the cubical. If you are large please make sure you fit in the shower so you don't hurt yourself.Room walls are very thin, we can here next room conversation( they are on there phone now..lol ),their phone ringing and early morning snoring.Breakfast is ok but there are no labels on what that item is so guess and eatOverall just ok good for location, however would not choose this hotel next time.

1329,"My boyfriend was here on business and I came along for vacation. Our room was in front - on a busy street, with police, trains and the trolley. I think Milan (maybe Italy?) has a system that does not allow you to lower the heat below 18 degrees Celsius? We would open the window for fresh air but when the railway crew is outside pounding on the rails at 1-2 am...you have to close the window to drown out the noise. The staff were amazing - in the hotel and in the restaurant. One female barista, however, was not so nice. You encounter this sort of attitude all over, so I just laughed and let it slide. The beds were nice and the bathroom was large. The shower was small but did the trick! We didn’t spend a lot of time in the room. We needed more hangers for our dress clothes and the staff were happy and swift to oblige. There are no drawers for clothes for longer visits. Perhaps on the other side of the hotel and in the suites? We were too busy outside of the hotel to care too much about the lack of clothes storage space. It is close to the train station and close to where a few tours depart from (Zani Viaggi, for example). Excellent location. ","April 1, 2019","28    Windsor Hotel Milano

Bronzino House is located in the Citta Studi neighbourhood of Milan, four metro stops from the Duomo in a quiet residential area near many very good restaurants and reasonably priced shopping. Bronzino House is a fully and tastefully modernized two bedroom apartment on the upper floor of a century old apartment building built around a courtyard garden. We stayed in one of the generously sized bedrooms (each with its own modern bathroom including rain shower and a great hairdryer) and were served a daily continental breakfast (including fresh croissants and cappuccinos!) by our host Walter (who lives in another apartment in the building). He graciously assisted us with restaurant reservations in the area; guided us on the use of the nearby metros; helped us prioritize our visits to major sites; and arranged a taxi for our return to Milano Centrale train station.

Walter, the host, is a lovely friendly man and kindly showed us around the B&B as we have an interest in building and architecture (he’s an Architect)...such a quality renovation/fit out with everything you would find in a top end hotel including a delightful 1923 lift - very handy as we had 2 large bags as in Europe for 2 months. This stay was lovely and we would highly recommend it to both individuals, couples and families - there’s a small kitchen and a shared dining space with pleasant/small verandah (see photos). A short walk (about 10 min) to the railway station through a well maintained area - mostly residential, apartments etc...train takes you into central Milan to see the main attractions (I think it was Lima station to San Babila station?) - for window shopping!... in the famous fashion district. Then onto all the famous places including the Piazza Castello (historic castle) etc. Walter recommended an itinerary and we had a wonderful day.

1359,"We stayed at Bronzino House in September at the beginning of a 5-week trip in Europe. We are now nearly at the end of this trip and I can say with complete certainty that Bronzino House was the very best of all our accommodations, especially in terms of the beautiful furnishings, the extremely high-quality linens, and the loving attention to detail provided by the owners. Walter was also an invaluable source of information about restaurants, galleries and museums, and other places to visit in Milan.

The flat is really top-notch and a testimony to the architectural artistry of the host. The rooms where equally nice and we slept like royalty in the comfy beds.

1363,"Bronzino House was a great choice for the start of our trip to lakes Como and Garda.The location is quiet, peaceful and safe. Bronzino House is a tastefully renovated two bedroom apartment overlooking a very pleasant private courtyard on the one side and a quiet street, from the terrace, on the other.The en-suite rooms were spotless, attractively decorated, with attention paid to detail. Walter, the host was very friendly, helpful and accommodating – I (one of 4 friends travelling together) arrived at 11.00 p.m. and he made no fuss about it. The continental style breakfast served by Walter, was adequate – the bread could have been more interesting.I wouldn’t think twice about staying at Bronzino House and would happily return in the future.","June 21, 2017","30    B&B Bronzino House

1364,"We chose Bronzino House because of the good reviews and the proximity to Linate Airport. As others have pointed out, access to your quarters on the fourth floor of an apartment building is by an antique lift, the type that used to be common in Paris. There is a surprise element when you are shown your room as it is larger than most hotel rooms and wonderfully designed and decorated with soothing colours. Window opens on to a nice courtyard. The bathroom designed by Walter himself, was excellent with a great rain shower. Lots of nice touches in the room, a radio which is rare in accommodation these days, and a press I liked as it had a light which automatically turned on as you approached it! Very comfy bed and the quiet make for a good night's sleep.Nice light breakfast in the morning served up by the host Walter who chats with you as you eat, something that would normally annoy me but as others have pointed out he is such a simpatico host with a fascinating background that we really enjoyed it. His restaurant recommendations were informative and helpful.Truth be told, we stayed in Bronzino House as a stopover on the way back from a holiday in the Piedmont and it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable evenings of our entire vacation. Highly recommended, and extraordinary value in a normally very expensive city.","April 30, 2017","30    B&B Bronzino House

1367,"What i loved most about B&B Bronzino House was the tasteful furnishing and attention to detail in the apartment. Walter and Evelina are such gracious hosts and they make you feel so much at home that you want to stay there longer! The rooms are beautifully maintained by the cleaning staff who comes in daily to keep the place immaculately clean. The apartment is centrally located in Citta Studi and close to popular bars, pizzeria's and restaurants. ( Do not miss ""Bar Basso"" which serves a very unique ""Negroni"" and the ""Osteria La Piola"" which served the best Osso Bucco I've tasted. both of these places are located just a stone's throw away from the apartment. The Metro is also a 10 minute walk from Bronzino House as well. A point to note: If you Love Art or are an Art Aficionado, try asking the host, Walter for advise/recommendations on viewing private art collections in Milan that are open to public but are off the ""popular tourist map"". My stay was pretty short so I just about managed to view one of them but there are definitely more that are on my wish list to see. So I am definitely going back :-)Oh did I mention this... The apartment has a quaint little terrace that is JUST PERFECT for an early morning espresso, cappucino or a simple cuppa tea that is served with your breakfast every morning before you start exploring Milan..I definitely will go back to B&B Bronzino and highly recommend it.Sharmila ","November 1, 2016","30    B&B Bronzino House

1368,"What makes a great place to stay? First is the location. The Bronzino House fulfills that as it is in a quiet, safe suburb of Milan. Last thing we want is someplace that is noisy and surrounded by other sterile hotels. Second is the comfort of the property. Here we have a perfect choice as it is updated and comfortable, but feels as if you would have chosen the design yourself. Two ensuite bedrooms [plenty of storage]with a kitchen/dining area and cosy outside terrace if you just want to relax and read. Quiet neighborhood with necessary stores nearby (e.g., grocery store/restaurants/pharmacy/tram[#23 to the Duomo] and metro stops a short distance away). Don't be put off by the high floor location of the apartment as there is a funky antique lift that gives you the feeling you have traveled back in time. Fit and finishings are extremely well done. A/C is welcome in the summer. Price is important and for a world-class city such as Milan it can't be beat. Finally, an intangible that is a tie-breaker is the owner. Walter and Evelina picked us up at our car rental return (extra charge, but less expensive than a taxi) at Malpensa as we did not want to struggle with luggage and the attendant hassle and gave us a nice tour of Milan before we settled in. Their enthusiasm and genuine friendliness was apparent from the moment we met them. He meets you each morning with fresh croissants and other goodies and recommendations if asked as well as his stories Re growing up in Ethiopia (who had a lion at his house?). Rely on his suggestions for restaurants as well as things to see in Milan. Wish we could take them with us on our travels. Definitely would stay with them again.","October 19, 2016","30    B&B Bronzino House

1376,"As my daughter and I only spent about 30 hours in Milan, we wanted to extract every moment of Milan's essence possible. This included our stay at Bronzino House. The Bronzino House, named after the street, and the building is very unassuming. Once buzzed into the building, we felt like we'd entered into a portal of hundred years of Milan's culture. The courtyard teemed with terrace gardens and would be gardeners who'd taken advantage of whatever green space they could call their own in the middle of a bustling city.The courtyard gave such a lovely presentation for our entrances and exits. Once inside, we were greeted by the hundred year old historical elevator which carried us up to the third floor. I thought the elevator was the charming and unscripted surprise of our stay. Once inside the apartment, everything looked exactly like the photos on this page. We learned that Walter's love of contemporary sleek lines inspired the design in his BnB. If Walter designed the bathrooms himself, I think he deserves acclaim because the shower and the sink and the whole bathroom for that matter was on point with the design boutique hotel we stayed in the following night in Paris. What I appreciated about our stay the most was Walter's charm. He obviously loves his time hosting wayward travelers. I would describe him as a generous people person. He took great pride in the breakfast part of our stay. He carefully selected every detail down to the best butters, jams and what we would describe in the States as ""upscale Nutella"". He offered both an aesthetically pleasing and filling breakfast fare. Our Sunday morning breakfast was relaxed and quite enjoyable as we got to engage in conversation with a lovely Italian family from the part of Italy as they called it the ""Heel"" of the Italian boot. Most wonderful about Walter, and he is the most wonderful part of the BnB experience, is that he generously agreed to allow us to keep our bags in our room for the balance of the day. He didn't have to allow us to keep the room keys past the time of our check out, but he did putting our needs above his own. We greatly appreciated this. He helped us secure our arrival and departure times and he even hailed a taxi for us to Linate Airport when it was time to go. How great it was to have that guidance when we were unsure of the times it would take to travel from place to place. That is just the kind of host he is.Walter understands traveling, anticipates his guests' needs and passionately strives to achieve hospitality perfection. There is no doubt that we will call upon Bronzino House again and we believe it is a fantastic choice for any would-be traveler.","March 19, 2016","30    B&B Bronzino House

After 2 weeks of carrying our luggage on and off trains, we decided to base ourselves in Milan and do day trips so we chose Bronzino House as our Milan base. What a great choice! The apartment is very clean, has beautifully furnished, modern bathrooms and nicely sized bedrooms. The wifi worked like a charm. There is a lovely terrace to enjoy and a sitting area between the rooms which has a bookcase stocked with maps and guides for the metro system and local points of interest. It was wonderful to stay in a Milan neighborhood which gave us a taste of what it is like to live there. One of the best things about Bronzino House is Walter himself! We so enjoyed our morning chats with him over breakfast. Walter gave us tips and information about nearby restaurants, the metro, local events and itinerary advice. We followed his advice and were never disappointed! We always felt very safe walking around this residential neighborhood and its location is very convenient as it is close to Linate airport and 2 metro stations.

1385,"There is a reason B&B Bronzino House has such a high rating on TripAdvisor--it deserves it. We were there in May and had a truly wonderful stay there. The B&B is in a lovely courtyard on the fifth floor (Italian fourth); the building has an elevator and also a large staircase. Our room was terrific, with ample closet space and a large chest of drawers, air conditioning, a refrigerator, and a great bathroom with probably the best shower you will find anywhere. Walter Amlesu, our host, designed the entire space beautifully. Outside the two bedrooms are a lovely sitting area with built-in bookshelves (filled with books, some in English), the breakfast area and glassed doors leading to an outside patio. We love B&B's, where we have a chance to talk at breakfast with our hosts and other guests, about our traveling experiences. All of that was true here, but Walter and Evelina made our stay in Milan immensely more enjoyable. We had wonderful morning conversations, especially with Walter, as Evelina works at another job. Yes, about things to see and do in Milan, and wonderful restaurants to try, but about so much more. About common interests, art, music, their lives and ours. The very essence of what makes traveling so spectacularly wonderful. And we aren't unique; if you see other reviews of this fantastic place, you will find similar comments. If you stay here, you will of course find an immaculately clean place, a lovely breakfast and all of the accouterments common to a hotel that travelers hope for but rarely get in a B&B. But I would venture to say that the consistent 5/5 rating this B&B deservedly receives from traveler after traveler is for the intangibles, and most especially for Bronzino House's wonderful hosts.","June 17, 2015","30    B&B Bronzino House

Bronzino House is situated in a large, five-story, stately apartment building in a quiet neighborhood of Milan. One enters the building through massive front doors, walks through an inner courtyard, and rides an old-time elevator to the next to top floor. The apartment is nicely furnished--contemporary, bright, with lovely artwork throughout--all the creations of an architect friend of the proprietors. Our room could not have been more comfortable ... a balcony off the dining room was very inviting. Walter, a retired civil engineer, is a fantastic host--breakfast was excellent, and the conversation wonderful and educational. Via Bronzino 20 is close to busy thoroughfares, good shopping, and great restaurants.

The great thing about this apartment for us was that we had the whole apartment to ourselves because we rented the two rooms in the apartment. Both rooms have their own bathroom / toilet facilities. There is also a small kitchenette, dining area and lovely balcony which the dining area looks out at. The apartment is furnished very elegantly and beautifully. It also looks new and is well maintained.Our hosts, Walter and Evalina, both seem like really lovely and friendly people. Unfortunately we did not see much of them only because they were away over Christmas. Walter gave us really good recommendations for dining and made reservations for us, too. He also assisted to help us make the booking for the cab and came very early on our last day in the apartment to serve us breakfast.This apartment is not near the Duomo area and the walk to the nearest train station (Lima I believe) is a good 10-15 minutes depending on your speed. If you need to get to the Milano Central Station, you would probably need to take a cab if you have luggage. However, the location feels very safe as it is quiet and mainly residential.

1389,"A wonderful stay, too short, I wish i could have stayed longer in Milano.Service is very personal, Walter and Evelina made my stay unforgettable. They made some great suggestions for me to see and do, to get the most out of my stay in the city. So much so, i returned in September. My hosts could not have been more helpful.The B&B is well appointed, beautifully designed. Very contemporary decor with some nice antique touches. The shower is big, the bed warm and comfortable. The B&B is on the top floor, and hence very quiet. The beautiful courtyard and streets immediately below are quiet.The location is very good, it is close to two Metro stations, or just a short walk from shops and Cafes' on Corso Buenos Aries. Breakfast is good, a nice choice of cereals, toast, fresh brioche and fruit. Coffee is served how you like it. There is a small but perfectly formed outdoor terrace, great to relax with a drink or book, or both.Ci vediamo l'anno prossimo.","December 27, 2014","30    B&B Bronzino House

1390,"We have just returned from a brilliant 2 night stay at Bronzini House and cannot wait to return! The location of the apartment is ideal; it is situated in a safe district in very close proximity to the tube station with a variety of restaurants and cafés nearby. Central Milan is a 10 minute walk, followed by a short tube ride. The apartment itself is beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean; pictures don't do it justice! Walter and Evelina went above and beyond in every respect and were exquisite hosts. They ensured that they were very prompt in responding to all emails, were around to welcome us, provided us with umbrellas and even went as far as sourcing some wholemeal bread at our request. We had a very early start on one day of our trip and they arranged for us to have breakfast at a cafe opposite free of charge! We learnt that establishments such as this in Milan are unable to provide home cooked breakfasts due to constraints within the city but breakfast was plentiful all the same. There were hot drinks, juices, toast with a variety of spreads, cereals, yogurts and pastries. We were also pleasantly surprised with the drinks and snacks that the cupboards and fridge were stocked with! It is evident that Walter and Evelina love what they do and take great pride in running this wonderful bed and breakfast. Walter was incredibly accommodating and wowed us with his charm and knowledge of Milan. He was kind enough to spend time helping us plan our journeys around the city and indicated points of interest on a map. Bronzino House felt like a home away from home and we would whole heartedly recommend staying it!","October 14, 2014","30    B&B Bronzino House

1391,"This review is long overdue. We were lucky enough to stay at this wonderful B&B in June 2014 with a couple of friends. It is a perfect place to stay if you are travelling on your own and especially if you are travelling with another couple. We felt like we were in our own mini apartment, it really felt like we were residents of Milan. Evelina and Walter are perfect hosts! We enjoyed their company so much, they truly made you feel like you were at home. They provided great recommendations and they were so accommodating always ensuring we had enough water during the heat of the day. Communication was great, we arrived earlier than I anticipated and they were available via e-mail, replied quickly, and made sure their son was home to greet us and help us with our luggage. Rooms are lovely, very modern, and have everything you need. The patio is another treat to enjoy some outdoor space. Very safe, great residential neighbourhood that is close to metro and some really great restaurants! Perfect place to stay in Milan! We really would not want to stay anywhere else!","September 6, 2014","30    B&B Bronzino House

The breakfast they provide includes croissants, toasts, yogurts, cereals and wonderful coffee. We very much enjoyed their company at the morning breakfasts - they are truly wonderful individuals and made our stay all the more enjoyable!The neighborhood is nice - we felt comfortable walking at night from the metro station. As well, its a significant walk (~2/3 miles) from the Duomo - but can be done stopping along the way.

It is in a very convenient location in Milan, we walked from there to all the places we wanted to visit so we didn't have to use our car. We had a suite with two bedrooms, one for us and one for our adult kids, a sitting area and a kitchen with seating. Every morning Walter and Evelina brought us our Italian breakfast and made tea. Then they stayed and chatted and helped us with finding the best places to visit and how to get there. They were delightful and very helpful. Our rooms were modern and nicely and comfortably furnished. It was in a very safe neighborhood and was very quiet. The only negative is that you have to search for parking on the street.

The two double rooms are restfully decorated in brown and cream, the bedlinen and towels are top quality, the bathroom is state-of-the-art with an enormous shower and complimentary toiletries. The closet space is generous and the light inside is a nice touch. There is a small refrigerator in the room and the wifi works perfectly. The room faces on to an internal courtyard and is very quiet. The breakfast (with fresh croissants and Nespresso) is served in a charming room with a terrace for use in good weather and you can make tea and coffee at will with the electric kettle and capsule coffee machine. Your charming and helpful hosts Walter and Evelina speak fluent English and French and are only too happy to help with anything you may need. There is a tram stop nearby which takes you straight to the Duomo and the metro is about a ten minute walk away.

1419,"We are a young couple (+dog) on tour for a combined work & leisure period in Milano. We’ve stayed in the NH Machiavelli hotel for six weeks (october till december). Well, then one get to know how good (or bad) a hotel is run. And we can confirm: by far the best (NH) hotel experience we ever had.And believe me, we’ve seen a lot of hotels insideout.To cut a long story short- from arrival throughout staying and departure; it was smooth, friendly and warm. No complaints whatsoever. But if we had an issue; it was solved quickly and professional. After this experience there is nothing that keeps us away from booking again. Thanks for making our stay as if we were (back) home.Extended review:What is important for us and was provided in this hotel? Clean, quiet and spacious rooms; good beds; enough supplies; a warm atmosphere; close to a supermarket; within walking distance to the city (20minutes) or public transport (1 minute); luxury; big breakfast buffet with at least lots of fresh fruit (Kiwi’s, Ananas and Oranges, etc.) and plenty to choose from. The frontdesk run by Carmen, Roberta, Giada, Antonio & Rocco plus all the friendly ladies. Antonio became our assistant in everything. The housekeeping ladies were every day on their best. (Thanks for keeping our room clean every day during our stay). The executive Chef Eduard and his kitchen staff are working hours every day their butts off to get a broad fresh breakfast buffet and evening diner. The personell running breakfast: Roberta, Rosario, Giovanni, Gilda such an amazing team. Special thanks to Gem for being so friendly in cutting our four kiwi’s and take care of everything. Tip: Get yourself a capuccinno made by Tarun; he is a Latte-art artist and makes the best capuccinno from their entire team (sorry!)Roomtip: if you are a light sleeper and like to sleep with an open window, avoid a room on the frontside. The trams in Milano sounds terrible while driving over the rails. And the avarage car driver will honk his car horn every minute. Further, the airconditioning in the hotel is shut-off after october by law. (We prefer an AC-cool room of 19 degrees). Open up the window when you are gone during the day. And in these days it’s quickly cold enough inside. If the room gets too cold; heating is modern, sufficient and swiftly warm.One complaint though: please change your background music in the lobby every once in a while. We know the cover song tape now from A to Z and backwards. ;-) perhaps an internet radio with mixed music styles?Last but not least, the general manager Davide is visible every day. During breakfast or late night diner. He is there. A good sign.","December 16, 2018","31    NH Milano Machiavelli

1427,Room spacious and clean. Continental and hot breakfast available. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Whole experience let down by no coffee and tea facilities in the bedroom other than through room service at 2€ plus 6€ cover charge. On principle this is not acceptable for a quality hotel. Disappointed as Italy is reputed to provide the best coffee in the world.,"July 24, 2018","31    NH Milano Machiavelli

1429,"We stayed here several nights. From the outside it's pretty nondescript and easy to miss, but it's right next door to the much more visible Hotel Ibis if you're looking for it. The weather was extremely hot, and the complimentary ice-cold lemonade in reception was well received. The superior room was roomy, pleasant and well appointed if somewhat dull in decoration. The wifi was hopeless and the TV reception was just on/off/on/off all the time. Staff were pleasant, the windows pretty soundproof, the a/c worked and breakfast was very good. There's a useful small supermarket next door and it's on a tramline to the city centre. There are plenty of nearby restaurants.","July 3, 2018","31    NH Milano Machiavelli

1431,"We largely chose this hotel because of price as we found Milan accommodation generally pricey. Our standard room was slightly dated but it was perfectly comfortable, clean and well appointed. There was little drawer or shelf space - I suspect because it is mainly used by corporate guests who perhaps only stay a couple of nights. Breakfast was good and the location which had slightly concerned us was actually ideal. It was simple to walk to the duomo and there was a metro station about 10 minutes walk away. We also walked from Statzione Centrale where the Malpensa Express arrives. There were lots of good restaurants nearby too","June 5, 2018","31    NH Milano Machiavelli

This time I found an outdated structure which definitely needs renovation. Urgent need: electrical sockets close to the night table to recharge the phone overnight (!!). Further I was disappointed not to find any coffee/tea set. I thus ordered 2 cappuccinos and continental breakfast in my room and was willing to pay 10 euro for the service but what I received was 2 cappuccinos, juice and 4 biscuits.

1455,"We recently spent 3 nights at Machiavelli and were welcomed by extremely friendly reception staff who were all willing to help throughout our stay. We stayed in a junior suite and the room was spacious with 2 bathrooms and good facilities- exceptionally clean too, which is always great. We had a good nights sleep and the hotel seemed quiet. However, the decor feels very basic and when we tried out the bar the 'barman' clearly didn't know how to make a mojito (which was on the menu) as it was filled 3/4 with vodka and we also ordered a martini based cocktail which I saw the man simply pour a whole glass full of straight martini! It was striking that we were the only people in the bar/restaurant at 8pm at night.. Breakfast was better with a good range of food and drink to set you up for the day. One lady (I think the manager with blond hair) was very friendly. The location is ok and is close to 2 metro stations and a 20 minute walk to Centrale station or 20ish minute walk to the cathedral. There just aren't many restaurants in the local area and it feels rather run down. Overall, I would say this hotel is perfectly catered for business men/women with function rooms & carpark, but for tourists I would probably suggest an alternative- especially if you are looking for 4*. (If it were a 3* hotel I would have given it 4* on Trip Advisor, but I don't feel it lives up to other 4* hotels in European cities)","July 12, 2017","31    NH Milano Machiavelli

1457,"I found the staff to be ok and the foyer and halls looked modern but the actual room itself must be a second priority to having a nice hallway. I stay at a similar looking room in Thailand and pay 500 baht. This is 99 euros and has cracks in the walls.Trying to find food in the area on a Sunday afternoon was not easy. Walk around the area outside and everything was shut. Restaurant in the hotel ""kitchen closed"". Room service don't answer phone. Ordering food online was not working either. The hotel advertises the restaurant to be open in the lifts and upon check in however only has a few dishes available to order. These must be pre-prepared or warmed up by the clerk as she insists the kitchen is closed.At 6pm I ask reception how I can get something to eat. She advises 6pm is a little early but sent me to mamma rosa 2 blocks away. Which was helpful. Breakfast buffet in the mornings... the spread is good and adequate. Lots of choices for cold items. One very small container of bacon and eggs that was empty the whole 40 minutes I was there. I left it open so staff could see it but they just closed it and wern't interested in topping it up. Buffet times are odd. It finishes at 12.00 on Sunday but 10.00 on Monday. So I missed out on breakfast on Monday arriving at 10.30. Doesn't make any sense to me. Also not seeing the ""verandah"" mentioned on the website.Other thing that annoyed me was cleaning staff ringing my doorbell at 9.30am on the day of checkout for no apparent reason. ""Scuzzi"" is all they said when I got dressed and answered the door. Then continue to talk loudly for 30 minutes outside my door.Airconditiining controls: Someone else mentions they are ""complicated"". I thought this was odd but now I understand what they meant. They controls are actually quite simple but not really working correctly. Incredibly touchy and you need to fiddle with it for a few minutes if you want to turn it off. Even then it is more like a fan and not very cool on it's lowest setting anyway. You can't open a window either.Wifi is free however late at night it can get quite slow. They do have a premium option that you can pay for which I didn't try.No tea and coffee facilities in room.No free drinking water in room.There is a safe in the room but it is very small and requires the room door card to operate. I presume housekeeping also possess this card.Its a very basic place and in some regards closer to a 3 star hotel if not for the carpark, buffet and nice halls.Also I notice an odd vibe both on check inn and check out. 3 clerks and 2 computers and a queue of people waiting. Just 1 lady working while the 2 others stand by awkawrdly in silence assisting her to fetch papers from the printer 1 metre away and do things she should be doing herself. Very odd.","June 12, 2017","31    NH Milano Machiavelli
